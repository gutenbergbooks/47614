<h2>WHEN SARAH WENT TO<br />
SCHOOL</h2>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER I</span> <span class="subtit">THE DRESS PARADE</span></h2>

<p class="fp"><span class="smcap">Across</span> the angle of the post-and-rail fence
at the lower corner of the Wenners' yard, a
board had been laid, and behind the board
stood a short, slender, bright-eyed young
girl, her hands busy with an assortment of
small articles spread out before her. There
were a few glass beads, a string of buttons,
half a dozen small, worn toys, a basket of
early apples, and a plate of crullers. When
they were arranged to her satisfaction, she
took an apple in one hand and a cruller in
the other, and, climbing the fence, perched
on the upper rail and began to eat.</p>

<p>Before she had taken more than two bites
an extraordinary procession appeared round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
the corner of the house. Ellen Louisa, one
of the Wenner twins, dressed in a long gingham
dress of her sister-in-law's, leaned affectionately
upon the arm of the other twin,
Louisa Ellen, who wore with ludicrous effect
a coat and hat of their brother William's.
Clinging to Louisa Ellen's hand was a small
fat boy. They solemnly approached the improvised
store.</p>

<p>"Is any one at home in this store?" asked
Louisa Ellen in a gruff voice.</p>

<p>The proprietress slid down from the top
of the fence. She spoke carefully, but she
did not quite succeed in disguising her Pennsylvania-German
accent.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, what is it to-day?"</p>

<p>"I want&mdash;" It was Ellen Louisa, who
spoke in a simpering tone&mdash;"I want a
penny's worth of what you can get the most
of for a penny, missis. I want it for my little
boy. Apples will do. He has it sometimes in
his stomach, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>A loud crash interrupted Ellen Louisa's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
account of Albert's delicate constitution.
He had seized the propitious moment for the
purloining of two crullers, and in order to
establish his ownership, had taken a large
bite out of each. It was the storekeeper's
quick grab which brought the counter to
the ground, and mingled all the wares in
wild confusion on the grass.</p>

<p>Albert looked frightened. When, instead
of scolding, Sarah dropped to her knees and
helped him gather up the toys, he stared at
her, bewildered.</p>

<p>"You'd catch it if I wasn't going to the
Normal to-morrow to be learned!" said
Sarah. "But to-day is a special day. What
shall we play next?"</p>

<p>The twins swiftly shed their superfluous
garments, and became two thin little girls,
who could scarcely be told apart. Their plaid
gingham aprons waved in the breeze as they
danced about.</p>

<p>"Let us play 'Uncle Daniel,'" they cried
together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Even sixteen-year-old Sarah hopped up
and down at the brilliancy of the suggestion.
Uncle Daniel Swartz was their mother's
brother, who lived on the next farm. After
their mother and father had died, and their
older brother had apparently disappeared
into the frozen North, whither he had gone
to seek his fortune, Uncle Daniel, who had
long coveted the fine farm, had attempted to
divide the little family and add the fertile
acres to his own. It was Sarah who had
stubbornly opposed him, holding bravely
out until William had come home. William
had married pretty Miss Miflin, the district-school
teacher, and, giving up his plans for
further adventure, had settled down to become
a truck farmer. Already he was succeeding
beyond his rosiest hopes.</p>

<p>Both he and his wife were anxious that
Sarah should go to school, and all the summer
Laura had been helping her to recall
the small knowledge she had had before
heavy care and responsibility had taken her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
from the district school. To-morrow she was
to enter the sub-Junior class of the Normal
School, which William and Laura had attended.
Laura had corresponded with the
principal, Doctor Ellis, and had engaged
Sarah's room. It had been a busy summer.
Sarah had kept up her Geography after she
had left school, but in other branches she
had needed a good deal of tutoring.</p>

<p>No one who saw her now, in her wild
game with the twins, would have guessed
that she had ever had any care or responsibility.
She assumed first the character of
Uncle Daniel; she told the twins that they
must go to live with Aunt Mena, she tried
to entice Albert away. Then she was Uncle
Daniel's hired man, Jacob Kalb, who had
translated his name to Calf, because he was
anxious to be thought English. In this r&ocirc;le
she was pursued round the barn by the
twins, who brandished an old, disabled gun,
which in Sarah's hands had once terrified
Jacob Kalb.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Once, in this delightful game, they passed
close to the fence beyond which Jacob himself
was working. Sarah balanced for a second
on the upper rail.</p>

<p class="poem">"Jacob Calf,<br />
<span class="fp">You make me laugh!"</span></p>

<p class="fp">she shrieked, and then jumped down backward.
The twins held the gun aloft, screaming
with delight.</p>

<p>The game closed with a scene in the Orphans'
Court, where Uncle Daniel demanded
that he be made their guardian, and where
William returned at exactly the proper and
dramatic moment.</p>

<p>"And now," announced Sarah breathlessly,
when it was all over, "I am going to
say good-by to everything."</p>

<p>A feeling of solemnity fell suddenly upon
the twins and Albert. Who would be storekeeper
on the morrow? Who would be
Uncle Daniel and Jacob Kalb and the judge
of the Orphans' Court in swift succession?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Who would help them with their lessons?
Who would defend them if Uncle Daniel
should ever come threatening again? Who
would draw bears and tigers and "nelephunts"
and all manner of birds and beasts?
"May we go fishing?" they would ask Sister
Laura, and Sister Laura would answer,
"Yes, if Sarah will go with you." "May
we write with ink?"&mdash;"Yes, if Sarah will
spread some newspapers on the table, and
sit beside you with her book." Would these
treats be forbidden them? Or would they
be allowed to do as they chose? But even
independence would be distasteful without
Sarah. Each twin seized her by the hand.</p>

<p>"It is a long time till Christmas," mourned
Louisa Ellen.</p>

<p>"<em>Ach</em>, stay by us!" wailed Ellen Louisa.</p>

<p>"And grow up to be like Jacob Calf!"
cried Sarah derisively. "I guess not! I am
going to be a teacher, and if you ever get in
my school, then look out! You will then
find out once if you don't study. I will then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
learn you Latin and Greek and Algebray
and more things than you ever heard of in
the world, Ellen Louisa and Louisa Ellen.
You would like to grow up like the fishes in
the crick. Good-by, crick!" Sarah drew
her hands away from the twins, and dabbled
them in the cool, fresh water. "Good-by,
fishes! Good-by, bridge! Good-by, bushes!
Why, Ellen Louisa! Louisa Ellen!" Sarah
looked at them with an expression of comical
surprise. Louisa Ellen and Ellen Louisa
were crying. "Stop it this minute!" She
seized Albert by the hand. Albert had
already opened his mouth, preparatory to
joining his sisters in a wail. "Albert and
I will beat you to the barn."</p>

<p class="poem fp">"One for the money,<br />
Two for the show,<br />
Three to make ready,<br />
And four to go!"</p>

<p>Louisa Ellen and Ellen Louisa did not stop
to dry their tears, but scampered over the
ground like young colts, their skirts flying.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
When Albert and Sarah got to the door, the
twins had vanished, and there ensued a game
of hide and seek such as the old barn had
never smiled upon. Sarah climbed about like
a monkey. She seemed to be in half a dozen
places at once. The twins thought she was
downstairs in one of the mangers, when suddenly
her voice was heard from the top of
the haymow. They played tag on the barn-floor,
they sang, they danced, with Sarah
always in the lead. It was certain that the
stately Normal School would open its doors
on the morrow to no such hoyden as this.</p>

<p>They were in the midst of</p>

<p class="poem">"Barnum had a nelephunt,<br />
<span class="fp">Chumbo was his name, sir,"</span><br />
</p>

<p class="fp">when the barn-door opened, and a young
woman appeared. She watched them for a
moment silently.</p>

<p>"Well, young Indians," she said.</p>

<p>The oldest of the young Indians clasped
her hands in distress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it time to get supper already?"</p>

<p>"Not quite. And if four members of the
family didn't insist upon having waffles, you
shouldn't help at all. Your clothes are all
ready, and I want you to come and see them."</p>

<p>The twins raced wildly toward the house,
and Sarah followed more slowly with her
sister-in-law and Albert. She looked shyly
and gratefully at Laura. She had not yet
grown quite accustomed to having "Teacher"
a member of the family. She had so long
looked up to her with awe and admiration
that her constant presence in the house did
not seem quite real. Laura often laughed at
her.</p>

<p>"I should think, Sarah, that after you had
cleared up my outrageous bread-dough three
times, and had taken my burnt pies from the
oven, you would begin to feel fairly well acquainted
with me."</p>

<p>Sarah flushed with embarrassment. It was
true that Laura was slow about learning to
cook. But cooking was such an ordinary,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
every-day accomplishment! It was much more
remarkable never to have had to cook.</p>

<p>"But now you can make good bread and
pies," she would insist.</p>

<p>The whole summer had seemed like a
dream. The house was no longer strange and
dark and lonely as it had been after their
father had died. Sarah no longer crept fearfully
about at night, fastening the shutters
before dark, for fear that Uncle Daniel would
try to get in. It had been a happy, happy
summer. William came and went, whistling,
teasing the twins, riding fat Albert round
on his shoulder. Uncle Daniel annoyed them
no more. "Teacher" bent with flushed face
over the stove, laughing at her mistakes, and
calling occasionally to Sarah for help; and
Sarah herself sat by the window, a little table
before her, on which were books and paper
and pencils.</p>

<p>The little table was gone from the window
now, the lessons with Laura were over, to-morrow
night Sarah would sleep away from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
home for the first time in her life. They had
expected that the trolley company, which had
given them a good price for the right of
way through the farm, would have finished
its line, and that Sarah would have been able
to go back and forth to school each week.
But the tracks had just begun to creep out
from the county-seat.</p>

<p>The twins had run upstairs; their deep
<em>ohs!</em> and <em>achs!</em> could be heard in the kitchen
below. They shrieked for Sarah, who was
already on the steps.</p>

<p>When she looked round the familiar room,
she clasped her hands and then stood perfectly
still. Beside her bed was an open trunk,
and spread out on the bed itself and on the
twins' trundle-bed was her outfit for school.
There were two school dresses, and a better
dress and a best dress,&mdash;the last of red cashmere,
with bands of silk. There were new
shoes and a new coat and two hats and gloves
and an umbrella and handkerchiefs and
underwear, all marked with her name, and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
gymnasium suit, and a scarlet kimono and a
comfort and pencils and tablets and&mdash;Sarah
began suddenly to tremble&mdash;a little silver
watch and chain and a fountain-pen.</p>

<p>"The little watch was my first one, Sarah,"
explained her sister-in-law. "It keeps good
time. And the fountain-pen is from William,
and the umbrella&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the umberella"&mdash;the twins and Albert
had seized upon it simultaneously&mdash;"the
umberella is from us. William, he sold our
Spotty Calf for us, and this is some of the
money, and you can make it up and put it
down, and it has a cover like a snake, and&mdash;Look
at it, once!"</p>

<p>Sarah took the umbrella in her hand. Her
school dresses had been tried on by Laura,
who had made them; she had known all about
those. And William and Laura had made a
trip to town and had been very short and
mysterious about the bundles they brought
home. She had supposed they had brought
a few things for her,&mdash;a new pair of shoes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
perhaps, or a new shawl. But <em>these</em> things!
Once, during her mother's lifetime, she had
had a red woolen dress; she still cherished a
patch which remained after it had been made
over for one of the twins. Except for that,
her dresses had always been of gingham or
calico. And two hats, when last year she
had had only a sun-bonnet! And a fountain-pen,
like Laura's, and Laura's own silver
watch! A lump came into Sarah's throat.</p>

<p>Perhaps Laura felt a lump in her own.</p>

<p>"Come," she said brightly but a little
huskily. "You must try these things on, and
you must hurry if you are going to bake
waffles for this hungry brood." With one
hand she took the umbrella from Sarah, with
the other she unbuttoned her gingham dress.
"Children, shut down the trunk-lid and sit on
it. Now, Sarah, the gymnasium suit first."</p>

<p>Sarah chuckled hysterically as she was
helped into the flannel blouse and bloomers.</p>

<p>"She looks like a bear," giggled Louisa
Ellen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Like a pretty thin bear," said Sister
Laura. "She will have to be fatter when
she comes home. Louisa Ellen, run and get
my work-basket. These elastics must be
tightened. Now, Sarah, the school dresses,
then the blue sailor suit and the blue hat.
You are to wear those to-morrow."</p>

<p>Sarah stared down at her dress, still speechless
with amazement and delight.</p>

<p>"And now the red dress. Your brother
William chose this color, Sarah, and your
hat and coat match it."</p>

<p>Fat and silent Albert opened his mouth
to speak.</p>

<p>"She looks like&mdash;" he began, but could
think of nothing to which to compare her.
"She don't look like nothing."</p>

<p>"She looks like a&mdash;a fine lady," said
Louisa Ellen. "<em>Ach</em>, when can <em>we</em> go to
the Normal?"</p>

<p>Laura had turned down the glass in the
old-fashioned bureau.</p>

<p>"Now, Sarah, take a good look, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
undress. These sleeves must be shortened a
little. I can do that this evening. I'll pack
the trunk while you get supper."</p>

<p>Sarah revolved obediently before the glass.
But her eyes saw nothing. The lump in her
throat seemed now to suffocate her; she
struggled frantically to swallow it, but it
only grew larger. The twins watched her in
fright. Presently Louisa Ellen slid down
from the trunk, and went across the room
and touched Laura on the arm.</p>

<p>"Something is after Sarah," she whispered
in shocked surprise. Never before had Sarah
behaved like this.</p>

<p>Laura laid down her work.</p>

<p>"Why, Sarah, dear! What is the matter?"</p>

<p>It was a moment before Sarah could speak.
She rubbed her eyes, then she looked down
at the new red dress, and the new red coat,
and then at the old gingham dress and apron
on the floor, and at her hands, on which still
lingered the marks of heavy toil.</p>

<p>"I would rather stay at home," she faltered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>.
"Ellen Louisa and Louisa Ellen can have
my things, and&mdash;and when they are big,
they can go in&mdash;in the Normal. I&mdash;I would
rather stay at home and do the work."</p>

<p>Laura sat down again in her chair by the
window, and drew Sarah to her knee.</p>

<p>"Why would you rather stay at home,
Sarah?" she asked gently. It was not strange
that a reaction had come. There had been
the struggle with Uncle Daniel, and then the
long, hot months of summer, and now the immediate
excitement of the afternoon. "Tell
me, Sarah."</p>

<p>"I am too dumb," wailed Sarah. "Nobody
can't teach me nothing."</p>

<p>"I thought I had taught you a good deal
this summer."</p>

<p>"But there won't be any teachers like you
at the Normal. I would rather stay at home.
I am too old to go any more in the school.
I am little but I am old."</p>

<p>"Like Runty," cried Louisa Ellen. The
twins had been listening in frightened and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
fascinated attention. Runty was a pig which
had never grown. "Runty is little, but he
is old."</p>

<p>Even Sarah had to smile at this.</p>

<p>"But you will have too much work to do,"
she said to Laura. "It is not right for me
to go."</p>

<p>Laura laughed.</p>

<p>"Cast no aspersions upon my ability to
keep this house, young lady," she cried gayly.
"And you will be no older than many of
the girls and boys in your class. Now take
off your dress and go mix your batter, and
in ten minutes I'll be there, and then William
will come home, and then we'll have
supper, and then you must go to bed early."</p>

<p>When William came, there was no trace
of Sarah's tears. He teased her gayly, as
William always did, and said, as he helped
himself to a fifth waffle, that the first four
samples were pretty good, and that now he
was really beginning to eat. It was not until
she was safely in bed that the lump came back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
into her throat. This going away to school
seemed suddenly worse than the long struggle
against Uncle Daniel. She was going to
live among strangers,&mdash;she would hear no
more dear, familiar Pennsylvania-German,
she would see only strange, critical faces.
The Normal students would probably laugh
at her, as she laughed at Jacob Kalb. They
might make rhymes about her, as she made
rhymes about Jacob.</p>

<p>Laura, who tiptoed into the room to put
the red coat with its shortened sleeves into
her trunk, heard her whisper.</p>

<p>"What did you say, Sarah?" she asked.</p>

<p>Sarah hid her face in her pillow in an
agony of embarrassment. She could not possibly
tell Laura what she was saying to herself,
and Laura, thinking that she was talking
in her sleep, tiptoed out again to complete
her preparations for the next day's
journey.</p>

<p>Before Sarah went to sleep, she smothered
an hysterical giggle. One possible rhyme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
which might occur to the Normalites had
come into her mind. It was that which she
had been saying to herself. It was ominous,
but she could not help laughing. It ran,&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Sarah's Dutch,<br />

<h2>CHAPTER II <span class="subtit">"THE NORMAL"</span></h2>

<p class="fp"><span class="smcap">In</span> the morning Sarah found, fortunately,
no time for regret or grief. She had said
good-by to the twins and Albert the night
before, and though they had loudly insisted
that they would be up in time to see her off,
they did not wake and were not called. The
three older members of the household had
breakfast together, then the new trunk was
lifted to the back of the spring-wagon, and
Sarah, in her new sailor suit and blue hat,
climbed to her place between William and
Laura for the drive to the station.</p>

<p>Her heart beat so rapidly that she could
not speak. She looked back at the broad,
low-lying house, shadowed by a great hickory
tree; at the friendly barn, which had been
a playground for them all; and then at the
winding, twisting stream, which made their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
land so fertile. Was it possible that a few
days ago she had wished to go away?</p>

<p>Up at Uncle Daniel's house, the family
was already astir. Jacob Kalb crossed the
barn-yard, milk-pail in hand, disdaining to
look back, though he must have heard
plainly the sound of the spring-wagon.</p>

<p>"He will go in and peek out," laughed
Sarah. "Jacob, he wouldn't miss nothing."</p>

<p>"'Jacob wouldn't miss anything' is what
you mean, isn't it, Sarah?" asked her sister-in-law.</p>

<p>"<em>Ach</em>, yes!" cried Sarah penitently.
"But what is coming?"</p>

<p>She grew pale. Down from the Swartz
house hurried Aunt 'Liza. "She can't stop
me!" said Sarah, gasping.</p>

<p>William laughed. "No, indeed."</p>

<p>Aunt 'Liza came to the side of the wagon.
She had never approved of Uncle Daniel's
methods.</p>

<p>"Here is something for Sarah," she said.
"I thought while she was going off I would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
make her a little cake, once, and a little apple
<i>schnitz</i>. She liked always apple <i>schnitz</i>."</p>

<p>Sarah jumped down over the wheel of the
spring-wagon.</p>

<p>"<em>Ach</em>, I thank myself."</p>

<p>And she seized the stout lady in a fervent
hug, which her aunt as fervently returned.</p>

<p>"And now," said Sarah happily, as she
climbed back, "I am not cross over nobody,
and nobody is cross over me. <em>Ach</em>, I know
I am talking dumb again! But after I get
on the cars, I will say everything right."</p>

<p>She could scarcely sit still. Laura and
William looked at each other and smiled.</p>

<p>In all her life Sarah had been on the train
but once. That was six months ago, when,
accompanied by the twins and "Teacher,"
she had gone to the county-seat to protest
against Uncle Daniel's being made their
guardian. She was too much worried then
to enjoy the roar of the great engine as it
rushed upon them, the hurry with which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
they scrambled aboard, the wild thrill of delight
as the train got under way. Now she
enjoyed each sensation to the full. There
had never been such a wonderful train as
this, whose seats were so luxuriously cushioned,
which moved so swiftly, which was so
filled with interesting persons. Sarah waved
her hand to William, she tried to call to him
a final message to the twins, and then they
were off. Sarah drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"<em>Ach!</em>" she wailed. "My trunk!"</p>

<p>Laura showed her the check. "Your trunk
is on the train, my dear."</p>

<p>"<em>Ach</em>, it is too wonderful!" cried Sarah.
"No, I won't say <em>ach</em> any more. <em>Ach</em>, but
I am going to try!" She clapped her hand
over her mouth and looked up comically.
"<em>Ach</em>&mdash;I can't express me without <em>ach</em>."</p>

<p>"Yes, you can," Laura assured her. "See
the girls opposite us. They're probably going
to the Normal School."</p>

<p>Sarah looked eagerly across the aisle. The
girls were laughing and talking together as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
though they had not seen each other for a
long time. They were tall and slender, and
they were unlike any girls that Sarah's admiring
eyes had ever seen. One had blonde
curly hair, the other was dark, with wide,
lovely eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you think I will know those girls?"
she whispered.</p>

<p>"Of course you will. Those and many
more."</p>

<p>Sarah clasped her hands happily. The stern
and critical race with which she had peopled
the Normal School suddenly ceased to exist,
and lovely creatures like these took its place.
Sarah's eyes brightened as she smoothed
down her new blue dress. Then she sighed.
The bothersome consciousness of her own
unworthiness overwhelmed her.</p>

<p>"The Normal will have a hard time to
make me look like them," she said to herself.</p>

<p>Once, long ago, when her mother and
father were still alive, and the twins scarcely
more than babies, the Wenners had taken a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
long holiday drive. One of the towns which
they visited was that in which the Normal
School was situated. It was then that her
father promised that if Sarah studied, she
should go there. She could see the school
as plainly as though it were yesterday instead
of eight weary years ago; she could hear
her father's voice. Her recollection of the
low house and the barn and the creek which
they had left that morning was not more
vivid. Before the train stopped, she saw the
tall tower, which she remembered; she knew
just how it overshadowed the other buildings.
And there had been beautiful trees and tennis-courts
and young people going back and
forth.</p>

<p>She scrambled down from the train, and
clung close to Laura, a little frightened by
the noise and confusion about her, the loud
greetings, the shouts of hackmen.</p>

<p>"This way to the Normal School. Take
my carriage, lady!"</p>

<p>They picked their way round a great pile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
of trunks, and Laura gave Sarah's check to
a baggage man. He touched his hat smilingly.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you back, Miss."</p>

<p>"Does he know you?" asked Sarah in
awe.</p>

<p>Laura smiled. A pink glow had come into
her cheeks.</p>

<p>"No. He only recognizes me for an old
student. We'll walk down to school. It
isn't far, and we'll both enjoy it."</p>

<p>A little farther down the street a grocer
stood at the door of his shop, and to him
Laura said good-morning.</p>

<p>"Does <em>he</em> know you?" asked Sarah.</p>

<p>"He remembers that I used to buy apples
from him. That is the place to get the best
apples in town. You see, coming back to
school is like coming back home."</p>

<p>"I never thought of that," said Sarah
slowly. She was to remember it clearly enough
months afterward. "But&mdash;"</p>

<p>They had turned a corner and come out
before a wide green campus. "But this ain't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>&mdash;<em>ach</em>!
isn't <em>my</em> Normal! It&mdash;it wasn't so
big, and this&mdash;this isn't <em>my</em> tower!"</p>

<p>"No, the tower you saw is the little one
over yonder. This is the new Recitation
Building. This wasn't here then. See, over
there on the Main Building is your tower.
And this is the Model School, and yonder
is the Infirmary, and away back there is the
Athletic Field, and&mdash;Ah, here we are!"
And Laura ran up the steps of the Main
Building as though she were coming to school
herself.</p>

<p>The wide door stood open, there was a
sound of cheerful talking from within. Sarah
heard a man's voice lifted suddenly above
the rest.</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Wenner, how do you do?
And this is your sister-in-law. We are glad
to see you both."</p>

<p>"Thank you," answered Laura. "Sarah,
this is Dr. Ellis. I think you said Sarah was
to have my old room."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the principal. "Eugene<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
will take you up and give you the keys.
Here, Eugene."</p>

<p>In another minute they were in the elevator;
then they went down a wide hall and
turned a corner.</p>

<p>"Here we are. I wonder whether your
room-mates are here."</p>

<p>It was the bell-boy who answered as he
flung the door open.</p>

<p>"It looks so, miss."</p>

<p>The two newcomers stood in the doorway
and gasped. Sarah was not entirely unacquainted
with confusion. She knew what
the kitchen at home looked like at the end
of a morning's baking at which the twins
and Albert had been allowed to assist. But
the twins and Albert at their worst could
accomplish nothing to equal this.</p>

<p>A room in which two trunks are being
unpacked is not expected to look very neat,
but this confusion seemed the result of careful
effort. There were dresses scattered here
and there, not on the backs of chairs, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
laid across the beds, but dropped to the floor
and in heaps on the table. There were shoes,
not set side by side, but widely scattered, a
slipper and an overshoe on the bureau, a
boot and a slipper on the radiator. A drawer
had been taken from the bureau and laid
on a bed; into it a trunk-tray had been
emptied, helter skelter, as though its contents
were waste paper. Apparently the owner
had been suddenly called away, for the tray
still lay upside down across the drawer.</p>

<p>To Sarah's Pennsylvania-German eyes, the
scene was terrible.</p>

<p>"You'll have to do some missionary work,
Sarah," Laura said merrily. "This closet
seems to be empty. Hang your hat here, and
take that bureau. We'll turn it this way so
that the light is a little better. That is the
way Helen Ellingwood used to have it when
she and I roomed here together. The school
wasn't so crowded and there were only two
of us. Now we'll take your pitcher down the
hall and fill it, and by that time your trunk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
may come, and perhaps the owners of these
clothes, also, and then we can clear up."</p>

<p>They made their way round the trunks and
boxes in the hall. A few doors away, a girl
who was bending over her trunk stood up
to let them pass. She turned her face away,
but not before they had seen that it was
streaked with black. Her hands, too, were
as black as ink, and she was crying. Laura
stopped at once.</p>

<p>"Why, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"I packed&mdash;a&mdash;bottle of ink&mdash;in my
trunk, and it&mdash;it has broken. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Laura looked into the depths of the trunk.</p>

<p>"Oh, my child! Have you taken the bottle
out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but the ink is there yet."</p>

<p>Laura pushed back her cuffs.</p>

<p>"Can you get me a lot of newspapers and
spread them thickly on your floor? There,
in the sunshine. Why, these things seem
black to begin with. Your gymnasium suit
is black, isn't it? And here is a black skirt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
See, it hasn't reached down to your books,
and the trunk isn't stained."</p>

<p>"But my white petticoats are&mdash;are all
black." The girl's tears made white channels
on her face.</p>

<p>Laura patted her on the shoulder. "Then
wash your face and hands, and run down to
the book-room and get some ink eradicator,
and I'll show you how to apply it. Come,
Sarah."</p>

<p>Sarah's bright eyes shone. Laura might
not know how to make waffles, but she knew
other, more wonderful things. Sarah's heart
swelled; she thought of Albert and the twins
in this safe care, and she slipped her hand
into Laura's without a word, and Laura smiled
down at her.</p>

<p>As they came back through the hall, they
heard a cheerful voice.</p>

<p>"I'll unlock the door, Eugene. Yes, we're
glad to be back. Move that trunk in here,
please. Gertrude, you brought a trunk-cover,
didn't you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>A dark-eyed girl appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ethel."</p>

<p>"They are our girls," whispered Sarah.</p>

<p>"Yes, and they are evidently other people's
girls."</p>

<p>The hall was suddenly crowded with a
welcoming throng.</p>

<p>By this time, Sarah's room-mates had appeared.
One was tall and stout; she said that
her name was Ellen Ritter. The other, who
was equally stout but much shorter, said that
she was Mabel Thorn. It was to her that the
bureau-drawer belonged. She lifted the trunk-tray
and slid the drawer into place.</p>

<p>"Our trunks must be out of here by night,"
she said. "They take them to the trunk-room.
Mine's ready."</p>

<p>"And mine," said Ellen Ritter.</p>

<p>She slammed down the lid, and pulled the
trunk into the hall, and Mabel pushed hers
after it. Two small, cleared spaces were left,
otherwise there was no change in the appearance
of the room. The girls did not return,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
even to close the door. Sarah, staring after
them, saw a smiling young woman poise for
an instant on the sill, a hand on either jamb.</p>

<p>"Well, Laura Miflin!" she said.</p>

<p>The speed with which Sarah had flown to
meet William upon his return from Alaska
was no greater than that with which Laura
crossed the room.</p>

<p>"Helen Ellingwood!" she cried. "What
are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"I am going to teach Elocution. Why
haven't you written to me? I didn't even
know you were married. I live next door.
And who is this, and how <em>are</em> you?" And
Miss Ellingwood pushed aside a pile of books
and underclothes and collars and sat down
on the edge of the bed. "These things don't
belong 'to you nor none of your family,' I
hope?"</p>

<p>Laura shook her head.</p>

<p>"This is my sister-in-law, Sarah Wenner,
question number one. I am very well and
very happy, question number two. No, these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
do <em>not</em> belong 'to me nor none of my family,'
question number three. What would you do
with them?"</p>

<p>"Spank the owners. Perhaps they'll clear
up, though. The first day is always demoralizing.
Now tell me everything you can think
of."</p>

<p>And Miss Ellingwood shifted to a more
comfortable position, and while Laura unpacked
and Sarah put away, the old friends
chattered until dinner-time.</p>

<p>The great dining-room, with all the confusion
of the first day of school, was an
awesome place to country-bred Sarah. She
was sure that she should never know one
face from another. She should never learn
to find her place.</p>

<p>"You must sit at my table," said Miss
Ellingwood. "There will be plenty of room
there to-day, and this afternoon I shall have
you assigned there permanently. This way";
and Miss Ellingwood put out a guiding hand.
Sarah began to take courage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>The afternoon seemed as long as the morning
had been short. Directly after dinner,
Sarah went with Laura to the train. She
did not see the rushing engine so clearly
now, nor watch the streaming white smoke;
her eyes, fixed firmly upon a slender figure
in a brown suit, were dimmed, and the strange
lump of yesterday had come back into her
throat. Now, at last, the moment of separation
had come.</p>

<p>She walked slowly back to school, and
about the grounds. Laura would be getting
home now, and William would have driven
to the station to meet her. Had the twins
done just as they were told all day? Had
they remembered the deserted kittens in the
barn? Would Laura be able to fix the fire
for the night?</p>

<p>Sarah ate her supper with difficulty. Miss
Ellingwood did not appear, the other students
said little, Sarah could not see her
room-mates, or the Ethel and Gertrude who
seemed a little less strange than the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
students, or the girl who had packed the
ink in her trunk. At the recollection of
her woe-begone face, Sarah smiled and felt
better.</p>

<p>"She is dumber yet than I," she said to
herself.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock there was a chapel service.
The gongs rang in the halls, and there
was a general opening of doors, and passing
of footsteps. Sarah followed her neighbors
down the hall. At the entrance to the chapel
stood Miss Ellingwood, a book in her hand.
She was assigning seats which the students
were to keep for the year.</p>

<p>"Wenner, Row B, left, seat 32. Down
there to the left, Sarah, near the girl in the
white dress."</p>

<p>Sarah made her way down the sloping
aisle. She had never been in any room larger
than the little country church, and this chapel
with its high ceiling, its fine chandeliers,
seemed marvelous. In the chandeliers, strange
to say, candles were burning instead of lamps.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>To her dismay, her seat was directly beneath
one of them. She glanced upward uneasily.
There was no contrivance to catch
the drippings, and everybody must know
that candles dripped. She looked down at
her new blue dress; it would be impossible
to get candle grease out of it. She meant
to speak to the girl in the white dress; then
she saw that Mabel Thorn was coming down
the aisle. She took the next seat.</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid of the candles?"
whispered Sarah.</p>

<p>"What candles?"</p>

<p>"Those, up there. They will drip on us."</p>

<p>Mabel tilted her head and looked up. Then
she grinned.</p>

<p>"Did you never hear of gas?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Stove gas," answered Sarah. "Our stove
makes it when the wind is not right."</p>

<p>"You never heard of illuminating gas?"</p>

<p>Sarah shook her head. "Never."</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?"</p>

<p>"Near Spring Grove post-office."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, the candles won't hurt you,"
laughed Mabel.</p>

<p>She got up and went across to the next
row of seats to where the girl in white was
sitting, and whispered to her, and they both
turned and looked at Sarah. Then she came
back to her place, as the chapel began to
fill, and whispered to the girl on the other
side, and she looked at Sarah and laughed.
Sarah became slowly aware that she had
said something very foolish.</p>

<p>Mabel did not wait for her when chapel
was over, nor did she and Ellen appear until
bed-time. Sarah had sat for a long time
staring across the moonlit campus, and waiting
to ask which bed she should take. There
were a double and a single bed side by side.
She supposed that the two friends would
wish to sleep together, but she did not know.
Once she heard the doleful strains of "Home,
Sweet Home," played on a mouth organ, and
some one called, "Have mercy on the new
students!" and there was a burst of laughter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>When Mabel and Ellen finally arrived,
they told her that she was to have the single
bed. She supposed that now they would
put the room in order. Well, she would cover
her head from the light, and be thankful.
But they undressed and tumbled into bed,
even before Sarah was ready, without touching
anything except the articles which were
in their way. In a suspiciously short time,
they were asleep.</p>

<p>Sarah lifted the clothes from the single
bed and laid them on the chairs, then she
attempted to blow out the light. Mabel was
wide awake in an instant.</p>

<p>"Turn it off there at the wall, you goose!"
she said; and was at once apparently asleep.</p>

<p>Sarah made her way warily toward her bed.
Having said her prayers, she laid back the
covers and jumped in.</p>

<p>Instantly there was a terrific crash, and
she went down with spring and mattress to
the floor. She was for the first second too
terrified to breathe, then she picked herself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
up and found that she was not hurt. There
was a faint light coming in through the
transom, and she could see that the slats
which supported the springs had become misplaced.
With a little help, she could readjust
them.</p>

<p>"<em>Ach</em>, would you please help me a little?"
she begged.</p>

<p>There was no response from the double
bed. Instead there came a heavy knock at
the door.</p>

<p>"Who is out?" asked Sarah faintly. If
the principal himself had replied, she would
not have been surprised.</p>

<p>A stern "Let me in!" answered her. She
drew her dress on over her nightgown and
went to the door. A strange figure stood
without,&mdash;a tall woman in a long, flowered
dressing-gown.</p>

<p>"What was that noise?"</p>

<p>Sarah pointed to the bed. "I&mdash;I didn't
know it would go&mdash;go down."</p>

<p>"Where are your room-mates?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Mabel and Ellen evidently thought it was
time to manifest signs of life.</p>

<p>"Here, Miss Jones."</p>

<p>"Can you explain this?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, we were asleep. Weren't we,
Sarah?"</p>

<p>"It just went down," stammered Sarah.
"I&mdash;I guess I jumped too hard on it."</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>It was the first time the Wenner name
had ever been mentioned with hesitation
and shame.</p>

<p>"Sarah Wenner."</p>

<p>The tall figure was gone, its silent departure
worse than threats, and Sarah closed the
door. Mabel turned over lazily.</p>

<p>"Get up and help her fix the bed, Ellen,
I saved her from blowing out the light."</p>

<p>Ellen rose, grumbling. Miss Jones lived
beneath them and was the strictest teacher
in the school, she said. Sarah would be haled
to the office to-morrow. She helped to put
the slats in place, and told Sarah not to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
make any more noise. Then, long after exhausted
and terrified Sarah had fallen asleep,
she giggled with Mabel until the night-watchman
rapped at the door. That, mercifully,
Sarah did not hear.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III <span class="subtit">SARAH LOSES HER TEMPER</span></h2>

<p class="fp"><span class="smcap">When</span> Sarah opened her eyes, early the next
morning, it was scarcely more than light.
She was accustomed to spring out of bed
before she was fully awake; there had been
very little time in her life for the last,
delicious nap of early morning. There was
always the stock to be fed, the cows to be
milked, and the milk to be taken to the
creamery, and afterwards the twins to be
roused and fed and sent to school. Since
Laura's advent, life had been vastly easier,
but the feeling of responsibility had not altogether
vanished from Sarah's mind.</p>

<p>There was something about the happenings
of the night before that sent her hurrying
out of bed as she hurried when the fear
of Uncle Daniel hung over her, when she
used to get up before daybreak to assure herself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
that the twins and Albert and the farm
property were all safely in place.</p>

<p>She could not at first make out where she
was; then the prodigious chaos of the room
recalled yesterday's experiences. And here
was her own bed, pushed out a little from
the wall, its covers all awry. She remembered
now distinctly what had happened last night.</p>

<p>Ellen and Mabel slept peacefully in their
double bed; and as she remembered her sudden
downfall and their lack of sympathy,
her face flushed. Snatches of their whispered
talk, heard in drowsiness, came back to her,
and she began slowly to guess that it was
neither the carelessness of the school bedmakers
nor her own light weight which had
sent the spring and mattress tumbling to the
floor. She felt a pang of fright as she remembered
the stern teacher in the flowered
gown. But surely, they would not punish
her for an accident! Presently a faint smile
lifted the corners of her mouth. There was
no doubt that it had been funny. But the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
girls might have waited until she was a little
more at home.</p>

<p>When she was dressed she sat down by
the window. There was not a soul to be
seen on the quiet campus, and not a sound
to be heard. It was almost six o'clock, and
she began to be hungry. She had forgotten
to ask the breakfast hour.</p>

<p>After a while there were faint noises, the
opening of a distant door, the sound of
sweeping down on the walks, and then the
ringing of a great hand-bell. Sarah heard it
first in a far corner of the building, then it
drew nearer and nearer, and she heard the
swift steps of Eugene, who carried it. As it
went past the door, she put her hands over
her ears. She smiled again, thinking that a
bell like that might wake even Albert and
the twins.</p>

<p>She began to be a little alarmed when she
saw that neither Ellen nor Mabel stirred.
She thought that Mabel's eyes opened, but
they closed again at once. Had the girls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
grown suddenly deaf, or were they ill?
Sarah tiptoed toward the bed and stared at
them. Both were breathing regularly. But
it was time to get up, and they would not
wish to be late for breakfast. Sarah laid her
hand on Ellen's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Stand up. It belled. <em>Ach!</em>" No, thank
fortune, they had not heard. Sarah took a
deep breath and amended her speech. "The
bell rang," she called. "It is time to get
up."</p>

<p>Still Ellen did not respond, and she went
to the other side of the bed and tried to
rouse Mabel.</p>

<p>"It is time to get up!"</p>

<p>A sleepy and cross "What?" answered
her.</p>

<p>"The bell rang. It is time to get up."</p>

<p>Mabel turned over on her other side.</p>

<p>"Let me be."</p>

<p>Once more Sarah sat down by the window.
Why did these girls not wish to get up?
Didn't they wish any breakfast? Didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
one have to get up? Perhaps they were like
the twins, who were cross at first but grateful
afterwards. She touched Ellen once more.</p>

<p>"It is time to get up."</p>

<p>Ellen sat up in bed.</p>

<p>"If you don't be quiet and stop bothering
me I'll settle you. You needn't tell me
when it's time to get up. I've been in this
school for a year." With that she lay down
again.</p>

<p>Once more Sarah sat down by the window.
The great building was astir now. She heard
doors open and shut, she heard girl call to
girl, she heard Miss Ellingwood moving
round in her bedroom, and still her room-mates
slept. Then an electric bell rang, and
motion and sound increased. Sarah started
toward the door. She would inquire whether
that was the signal for breakfast, and she
would go down. But a sharp voice stopped
her.</p>

<p>Ellen and Mabel had sprung out of bed as
though tossed by springs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sarah," commanded Mabel, "run down
the hall and fill this pitcher."</p>

<p>A look of distress came into Sarah's black
eyes.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I will be late."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Hurry."</p>

<p>Sarah flew down the hall. She met a score
of girls going toward the elevator, and they
looked at her smilingly.</p>

<p>"You'd better hurry, youngster."</p>

<p>"<em>Ach</em>, I am!" answered Sarah.</p>

<p>To her amazement Ellen and Mabel were
almost dressed when she returned. She would
have set the pitcher down inside the door
and then run, but Mabel called again.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. You're too late now
to get in without permission, and you don't
know where to go for that. See whether you
can find a blue belt in that pile."</p>

<p>Sarah's tears dropped upon the pile of
collars and ties and belts.</p>

<p>"I would rather not go than be late," she
said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>The girls laughed. Mabel took the belt
from her hand and hung it over her arm,
meaning to buckle it as she ran.</p>

<p>"All right, you little goose," she said;
and then the door closed behind them with
a slam.</p>

<p>Sarah was desperately frightened. Perhaps
they called a roll and the absentees
were punished. There was no one in sight
in the hall from whom she could ask advice,
and she began wearily to make her bed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I will have to pack my trunk,
too," she said to herself. "But if I do not
know what to do and nobody will tell me,
how shall I find out?"</p>

<p>She felt a thrill of both terror and relief
when she heard a footstep in the hall. It
came directly to the door, there was a rap,
then the door was pushed open.</p>

<p>"Why, Sarah, don't you want any breakfast?"</p>

<p>Sarah made a brave effort to steady her
voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you come down?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I was too late," stammered Sarah.</p>

<p>"Well, come now, and to-morrow morning
you will begin a little earlier." Miss
Ellingwood held out a kindly hand. "Won't
you?"</p>

<p>Sarah stammered another "Yes, ma'am."
She could not say that she had been up
since five o'clock, because that would involve
explanation, and she did not wish to
be a tale-bearer.</p>

<p>She caught Ellen Ritter's eye as they
went down between the long lines of tables,
and Ellen grinned and nudged Mabel. But
Sarah did not care. Some one was interested
in her. Miss Ellingwood had left her breakfast
and had come all the way upstairs to
find her. She ate her breakfast cheerfully,
answering shyly the remarks of her companions.</p>

<p>"Now, when the next bell rings, you
must go to the chapel," said Miss Ellingwood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
"Take a tablet and pencil with you, and
then you can write down your classes for the
day. And if you get into any difficulty,
come to me. The bell will ring at eight
o'clock, and you know where the chapel is."</p>

<p>At half-past seven Sarah took her tablet
and two neatly sharpened lead pencils, and
stole out of her room. Nobody should prevent
her from being on time now. She went
down quietly and opened the chapel door.
Then she realized that she had forgotten the
number of her seat. If she had such difficulty
with little things, what would she do
when lessons began?</p>

<p>Suddenly she remembered with a throb of
relief the chandelier whose dripping she had
feared. She sat down in a chair which was,
as nearly as she could guess, the one she had
occupied the night before, and bent her
head back to look up. Yes, it was from this
spot that she had seen the dangerous candles.
She sighed thankfully, and proceeded to
write her name on her note-books, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
to read the school catalogue, which gave a
list of her lessons.</p>

<p>There would be Physiology, Arithmetic,
Spelling, and Political Geography, to begin
with. In each of these she would have three
recitations a week, and she must pass an
examination in them before the State Board
at the end of the year in order to enter the
Junior class. Besides, she would have less
frequent lessons in Latin, History, and Grammar.
In these branches she would not have
to be examined, except by her teachers, until
the end of her Junior year. Each week she
would also have an hour's exercise in drawing
and in vocal music. And every other day
she would have to spend three quarters of
an hour in the gymnasium. Sarah shook her
head solemnly. It seemed like a large contract
for so small a girl.</p>

<p>All the morning she went to classes, gaining
in each room a new book, a new note
on her tablet, and a redder flush on her
cheeks. By noon the pile of books had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
grown almost to her chin. She carried them
proudly across the campus and up to her
room.</p>

<p>It was going to be hard, but not as hard
as she had feared. She had naturally a quick
mind, far quicker than she suspected. There
were two branches in which she had a valuable
advantage. Political Geography would
be only a review. Her father had been a
dreamer, loving accounts of strange cities
and far countries, and in the long evenings
after he had become ill, he and Sarah had
pored over the atlas, following William on
his long journey, and trying to picture the
strange countries on the other side of the
world. There were few countries which Sarah
could not bound, few rivers and cities which
she could not locate.</p>

<p>Nor would Spelling be hard. The Wenners
were naturally good spellers; even little
Albert could spell simple words like "cat"
and "dog."</p>

<p>But there were Physiology and Arithmetic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
and History. The History had already given
her a bad fright.</p>

<p>Professor Minturn, opening the course
with a lecture on the interest and value of
historical study, had suddenly looked about
the class to find some one to read a paragraph
from the text-book illustrating what he was
saying. Sarah's face, bent eagerly forward,
attracted him, and he asked her her name and
told her to read. The color flamed into her
cheeks, and with trembling hands she found
her place in the book, and then rose. Instead
of standing still, she walked to the
front of the room, and, in a fashion learned
before Laura had come to teach the Spring
Grove School, "toed" carefully a crack in
the floor, lifted her book to a level with her
chin, and began.</p>

<p>"Page three, chapter one, paragraph four.
'The Study of History.'"</p>

<p>Wild laughter interrupted her, at which
Professor Minturn frowned and sternly commanded
silence. He was a nervous, easily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
irritated man, who never felt that his students
worked hard enough.</p>

<p>"Go on, Miss Wenner."</p>

<p>Sarah read through the paragraph with a
voice which she strenuously endeavored to
make steady. It seemed to her that she had
never seen so many <em>th</em>'s and <em>v</em>'s, which she
was just learning to pronounce. But she got
safely to the end, and then fled to her seat.</p>

<p>"I have never heard a paragraph read
more intelligently," commented Professor
Minturn grimly, thereby adding to her confusion.</p>

<p>Of all her lessons, Latin promised to be
the most terrible.</p>

<p>"I will not talk to the twins again about
learning them Latin," she said to herself,
with a sigh. "But the teacher, he seems like
a kind man. Perhaps he will help me sometimes
a little."</p>

<p>In her room that afternoon, she handled
the books as though they were loved dolls.
Sarah had never really owned a book. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
school-books from which she had studied
had belonged to William, and now were
used by the twins. If anything remained of
them after the twins were through with
them, they would go to Albert. But these
were hers, they were new, she might write
her own name in them, she might keep them
all her life.</p>

<p>The confusion in her room worried her,
but she turned her back upon it, and set
resolutely to work. By the time that Ellen
and Mabel came in to prepare for gymnasium
she had learned her History lesson and discovered
that she need not study her Spelling.</p>

<p>The period of gymnasium proved to be
another surprise. To a girl who climbed to
the upper rung of the barn ladder and the
top of a tall hickory tree, and who could
churn butter and drive a fractious horse,
the simple exercises with wands and dumb-bells
were child's play. She wished to get
back to her work, she wished to touch again
the clean, white books.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>Ellen and Mabel laughed at her unmercifully.
They had been in the Normal School
for a year, and had learned and invented
many ways of shirking. After supper they
announced that they were going to straighten
up the room, and for five minutes, during
which they had scarcely made a beginning,
they worked diligently. Then Ellen threw
herself down on the bed, and declared that
she was tired. For a few minutes there was
a welcome silence, then Ellen began to giggle
and got up and left the room. By the time
she returned, Mabel had taken her place on
the bed.</p>

<p>"Sarah," Ellen began pleasantly; and
Sarah, marking the place in her book, looked
up despairingly.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I met the bell-boy in the hall, and he
said that your brother is here."</p>

<p>Ellen was frightened by the sudden terror
on Sarah's face.</p>

<p>"My brother!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. Oh, nothing is wrong. I think he
is just here in town and wishes to see you.
And there are people in the reception room,
so Eugene will bring him up here in a few
minutes. Mabel and I will go out."</p>

<p>Mabel got up quickly from the bed.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>Sarah rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"<em>Ach</em>, you needn't go! And"&mdash;she
looked round the disorderly room&mdash;"couldn't
we fix here a little up once?"</p>

<p>Ellen and Mabel shouted with laughter.</p>

<p>"There isn't time to fix here a little up
once."</p>

<p>When the door was closed, Sarah looked
about once more. She was frightened by
William's coming, she was distressed that
he should see such a room. Ellen and Mabel
had not even made their beds. Those, at
least, she would spread up. If he would only
delay for a few minutes, she might make
the room look presentable. She drew the
curtain across the alcove where the washstands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
stood, and hung her room-mates'
dresses in the closets. For an instant she
was tempted to toss them in on the floor
and shut the door on them. But Sarah had
had too few nice dresses in her life to treat
them roughly. The shoes were swept into
the closets, the bureau drawers were filled
and closed; then, as she heard a step in
the hall, she smoothed her hair and went to
the door.</p>

<p>"Wil&mdash;" she began, and then gasped. It
was a man who stood without, but it was
not William. No; it was not even a man.
There was a fluffy tie above the collar of
his rain-coat, his derby hat was pinned on
with a hat-pin, the hand which he held out
was decked with rings.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Sarah,
trembling.</p>

<p>"Aren't you glad to see me?" giggled
Ellen.</p>

<p>"Where is my brother William?"</p>

<p>"I am your brother William. I&mdash;Why,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
look at this room! She has put it all in
order! Mabel!"</p>

<p>There was a burst of wild laughter, then
the two girls ran down the hall to return
the clothes to the girl to whose brother they
belonged. "I never knew such a joke."</p>

<p>Sarah went inside and shut the door.
Then she locked it and stood with clenched
hands. It was cruel to play such a trick.
They had frightened her, and now she was
desperately disappointed. And she had lost
at least a half-hour, and it was only two
hours until the lights were put out. She
would not let the girls come in again; they
would not study, they might visit their
friends. With shaking hands she opened
her books.</p>

<p>But she could not study. She heard another
burst of laughter. Probably they were
telling the other girls about it, and they
were laughing at her.</p>

<p>Presently her heart ceased to beat so rapidly
and she settled down to work once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
more. Perhaps they would not come back.
She knew that it was against the rules to go
from room to room during study-hours, but
they did not keep rules.</p>

<p>"'Man is the only living creature that can
stand or walk erect,'" she began aloud.
"'Man is the only living creature that can
stand or walk erect. The human skeleton&mdash;'"</p>

<p>The knob was softly turned; then there
was a knock at the door. Sarah did not
answer.</p>

<p>"Let us in, Sarah."</p>

<p>Still Sarah made no response.</p>

<p>"Open the door, Sarah."</p>

<p>"No, I am not going to open the door,"
cried Sarah shrilly. "You can just stay out."</p>

<p>A long silence succeeded. She settled
again to her work.</p>

<p>"'Man is the only living creature that can
stand or walk erect. The human skeleton&mdash;'"</p>

<p>When there was another knock at the
door, Sarah started up furiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can knock all night and I won't
let you in," she shrieked. "You are all the
time after me, you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again the knob was turned. She did not
realize that the voice which bade her unlock
the door was lower and softer than those to
which she had been listening. She was too
angry to distinguish one voice from another.
The girl who had withstood the persecutions
of an Uncle Daniel would not endure forever
the teasing of two girls of her own age.
She seized her pitcher from the stand. Not
without much spilling of water on floor and
bed, she climbed to the footboard.</p>

<p>"Will you go 'way, then!"</p>

<p>"Sarah, open the door."</p>

<p>"I won't." And Sarah turned the pitcher
upside down, its mouth protruding from the
transom. There was a splash, a quick exclamation,
and then a stern command.</p>

<p>"Open this door, or I shall send for the
principal."</p>

<p>Sarah moved but slowly, not from choice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
now, but from fright. A terrible, unbelievable
suspicion entered her mind. It seemed
that her hand would never be able to turn
the key in the door, that strong little hand,
which lifted so easily the great, brimming
pitcher. If it had been the teacher who lived
downstairs, the cross teacher with the flowered
dressing-gown, she could have endured
it. If it had been the principal himself, it
would not have been so terrible. But standing
on the threshold, wiping the water from
her eyes, and with dripping hair and soaking
shirt-waist, stood Miss Ellingwood.</p>

<p>Behind her, Ellen Ritter and Mabel Thorn
twisted their faces to keep from exploding
in shocked and delighted laughter, and down
the hall, doors were opening and excited
voices asked what was the matter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV <span class="subtit">SARAH EXPLAINS</span></h2>

<p class="fp"><span class="smcap">Many</span> years afterward Sarah said that
nothing in her life had ever frightened her
like the sight of Miss Ellingwood standing
outside her door, with the water dripping
from her hair and dress. Miss Ellingwood
herself came to laugh heartily at it, but no
amount of teasing could ever induce Sarah
even to smile. It seemed an hour until Miss
Ellingwood spoke, and in that time Sarah
saw clearly not only the laughing, triumphant
faces of her room-mates immediately
before her, but of all the family at home:
William and Laura, who were sending her
to school at a great sacrifice, the twins and
Albert, who had faith in her, and to whom
she should have been an example. She
seemed to hear herself trying to explain to
them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"You see, it was this way," she would
begin. But she never got any further. There
was no explanation, no excuse to make.</p>

<p>"This," they would say, "this is what you
do with your education!"</p>

<p>In reality, it was only a moment until Miss
Ellingwood spoke. Her eyes flashed; it seemed
to Sarah that they would burn through her.</p>

<p>"Come to my room in half an hour. I
don't want to hear anything from you now."
Then she turned to the girls laughing behind
her, and her eyes flashed still more
brightly. Perhaps it was for their illumination
that the flash existed. "You have been
here for a year, and you know the rules of
the school. Dr. Ellis will hold you responsible
for any misconduct in this room, rather
than a newcomer."</p>

<p>Ellen and Mabel looked at each other
guiltily as Miss Ellingwood's door closed
behind her. Then they went to their own
room.</p>

<p>Sarah was not to be seen, and their uneasiness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
turned to fright. There was no exit
save through the window, and they were on
the third floor. It could not be possible that
she was as badly frightened as that!</p>

<p>"Sarah!" cried Mabel sharply.</p>

<p>Sarah appeared from the closet. She had
taken off her school dress, and carried the
blue one across her arm.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked
Ellen.</p>

<p>Sarah did not answer. If she tried to
speak, she should scream. She would at least
put on her second-best dress and brush her
hair before she went to Miss Ellingwood's
room. She remembered in agony that she
had never worn her red dress; probably she
would never have an opportunity now, at
least at the Normal School. She looked at
her little silver watch with eyes which could
scarcely find the hands.</p>

<p>Mabel and Ellen avoided each other's
glance, and sat down by the table.</p>

<p>"What is the History lesson for to-morrow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Sarah?" asked Ellen in a tone which
was meant to be conciliatory.</p>

<p>Sarah silently pushed forward her note-book.
She was dressed now and staring at
her Physiology. "Man is the only living
creature that can stand or walk erect." In
what long-past stage of her life had she read
that?</p>

<p>At twenty-eight minutes past eight, she
closed her book and went into the hall, where,
watch in hand, she lingered outside Miss
Ellingwood's door until the hand pointed to
the half-hour. Then, fearfully, she rapped.</p>

<p>A low "Come in" answered. It took all
her strength to turn the knob. She saw nothing
of the beautiful room with its books,
its fireplace, its wide and crowded desk, its
low tea-table; she saw only Miss Ellingwood
entering from her bedroom beyond, her curls
wet and shining, clad in a fresh, stiffly
starched white shirt-waist and a dry skirt.
She went across to the big chair before her
desk, and turning her head away, stooped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
to straighten out some papers. She saw the
blue dress, and the smooth hair. Both judge
and defendant, she said to herself, were
dressed for the occasion.</p>

<p>"Now, Sarah," she began, "suppose you
tell me how it is that an inoffensive non-combatant,
rapping at your door, is received with
a shower of water. Your room-mates asked
me to get you to let them in. They said that
you had locked them out, and they couldn't
study. Is this true?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," faltered Sarah.</p>

<p>"Why did you do it?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;they&mdash;<em>ach</em>!" Sarah burst
into a flood of tears. She did not wish to tell
on them, she could not bear to recount the
foolish trick which had been played on her.
It seemed so ridiculous now to have been
taken in. It was so absurd,&mdash;her anxiety at
hearing that William had come, her mystification
at the foolish figure which met her at
the door, her rage, when she realized what
they had done. That was worst of all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>"<em>Ach</em>, if you will only let me make it up
to you," she cried. "I will never do such a
thing again. I will dry your hair if they are
wet yet, and I could iron your shirt-waist,
and if it is spoiled, I could try to earn some
money to buy you a new one. Or William
would send me the money right away. I
could give you my umbrella to make up, or
my f-fountain-pen. They are new&mdash;they&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mercy, child!" Miss Ellingwood put her
arm round Sarah, who in her anguish had
moved close to her side. "Don't cry about
my clothes, <em>please</em>. They are almost dry
already, and water couldn't hurt them. I'll
forgive you willingly, entirely, Sarah. But
you must never do anything of the kind
again. You see the evening study-hour is
meant for work. You have long hours in the
afternoon and earlier in the evening to play,
and all day Saturday, and you need every
minute in study-hour. By the time you get
settled to work again, you will have lost a
whole hour."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know it, I know it!" wailed Sarah.
"That is the trouble. They will not let me
study. When&mdash;when they are out I can
study, but not when they are with. I will
have to go home. I am anyhow too dumb
for anybody to learn me anything."</p>

<p>Miss Ellingwood hid her face against
Sarah's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Say that again, dear."</p>

<p>"<em>Ach</em>, I mean I am too&mdash;too stupid to
be taught."</p>

<p>"That is better. Now&mdash;" Miss Ellingwood
meditated for an instant. She did not approve
of putting three persons into a room;
even she and Laura had been a little crowded.
It would be very difficult for this child to
get into studious habits if she were constantly
in the room with Ellen and Mabel.
They were very evidently not diligent. "Suppose
you bring your books over here this
evening, Sarah. Perhaps you can study here."</p>

<p>Sarah was not gone for two minutes.
Ellen and Mabel had disappeared, and she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
gathered her books together, made another
dab at her hair with her stiff brush, and was
back.</p>

<p>Miss Ellingwood had pulled a chair up to
the side of her own desk.</p>

<p>"There, Sarah, is a chair and a foot-stool.
Now, if I can help you, ask me." And she
bent her head over her own work.</p>

<p>Peace descended upon Sarah's heart. Once,
she sighed, and Miss Ellingwood looked up.</p>

<p>"Are you tired?"</p>

<p>"<em>Ach</em>, no! I am just thinking. It is so
nice and still here. I could learn the whole
book through."</p>

<p>Once she ventured to ask a question.</p>

<p>"Please, ma'am, it gives a word here.
I cannot say it right, s-y-n, swine, t-a-x, tax,
swinetax. Is that the way to say it?"</p>

<p>"No. S-y-n, sin&mdash;syntax. It is not English
to say, 'it gives a word here,' Sarah.
Try again."</p>

<p>"Here is a word," said Sarah painstakingly.
"<em>Ach</em>,&mdash;no, I don't mean <em>ach</em>!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
But will you tell me sometimes when I am
wrong?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>Sarah gazed at Miss Ellingwood with deep
admiration and gratitude, and set again to
work. She had only the simple Latin rules
to commit to memory, and then all the lessons
assigned her would be learned, even
though it was not until the day after to-morrow
that she recited them.</p>

<p>But the page of rules was the most difficult
task she had attempted. The words
seemed to dance before her eyes, the lines were
crooked, the letters blurred. She propped
her head on her hand, and rubbed her eyes
a countless number of times.</p>

<p>Miss Ellingwood was too much engrossed
by her task to see. Each year under the direction
of the teacher of Elocution, the
Junior class gave a play. It was given usually
the week before Christmas, and Miss Ellingwood
had selected an arrangement of
Dickens's "Christmas Carol," whose spirit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
was so appropriate to the season. She was
going over it now, so that the parts should
be fresh in her mind before she began to get
acquainted with the Juniors in her classes,
and she smiled at old Scrooge and sighed
over Tiny Tim. She had quite forgotten the
student at her side.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, there was a dull little
bump, as her guest slid from her chair to
the floor, asleep. Strange to say, the fall
did not rouse her. Miss Ellingwood thought
that she must be sleepy indeed.</p>

<p>"Come, Sarah," she said. "You must
get up and go to bed."</p>

<p>With Miss Ellingwood's help, Sarah got
up slowly, and sat down on her chair, and
was immediately asleep once more. Miss Ellingwood
was a little frightened. The child
was evidently exhausted, which was not
strange after her passion of tears. Miss Ellingwood
glanced at her again, then at the
couch which had been made up for a guest
who had not arrived.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>In a moment she went down the hall and
rapped at the door of Sarah's room. No one
was within. Smothered laughter a little farther
down the hall implied the presence of
Ellen and Mabel. Miss Ellingwood took a
few steps in that direction, then returned.
The warning bell would ring in a moment;
after that, for fifteen minutes, the students
were allowed to visit one another. This was
really the first day of school, and rules were
not so strictly kept. And Miss Ellingwood
hated to scold.</p>

<p>She pushed open Sarah's door and went
in, to look for her school dress and the things
she would need for the night.</p>

<p>The smothered laughter became open
shrieks as the warning bell rang.</p>

<p>"She's a perfect little spitfire," Ellen Ritter
was saying. "I wish you could have seen
her face when she saw me all dressed up. It
was white and purple by turns, she was so
angry."</p>

<p>Ethel Davis and Gertrude Manley, going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
arm-in-arm down the hall, had stopped at
the door to hear, and the group of sub-Juniors
opened to let them in. Blonde Ethel
and dark-eyed Gertrude were Juniors, the
next year they would be Middlers, and after
that Seniors, and they sometimes allowed
the dignity of their position to awe the sub-Juniors.</p>

<p>"I think it was a pretty mean trick to
play on such a youngster," said Ethel hotly.
"Now, if you had played it on Mabel, or
Mabel on you, it might have had some point."</p>

<p>"Oh, she can take care of herself," laughed
Ellen. "You needn't worry about her! Then
she locked the door, and wouldn't let us in,
and Mabel and I were very anxious to study,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Doubtless," laughed Gertrude.</p>

<p>"Well, we were, and we knocked and asked
politely to be let in, and not a word would
she say. So we went over to the new hall
teacher and told her that we were afraid our
little room-mate was ill. So she came over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and rapped, and there was no answer but a
wild yell. And then&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ellen rolled over on the bed, helpless with
laughter, and Mabel took up the tale.</p>

<p>"Then out of the transom came a pitcherful
of water,&mdash;bang!"</p>

<p>"Not on Miss Ellingwood!" said Ethel.</p>

<p>"Yes, right on Miss Ellingwood."</p>

<p>Mabel's cheeks were flushed with pleasure.
Ethel and Gertrude never paid much attention
to her, and it was delightful to have
them listen so closely.</p>

<p>"What did she do?"</p>

<p>"Told the youngster to come over in half
an hour, and the youngster put on her Sunday
dress and went over."</p>

<p>"And what then?" asked a breathless
sub-Junior. "Did Miss Ellingwood nearly
murder her? That's what I should have
done."</p>

<p>"No. I guess Sarah told her the whole
tale, because in a few minutes she came back
and got her books, and she's been over there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
all evening. There'll be no more fun on
this hall with a teacher's pet spying on us.
I suppose Miss Ellingwood will come in after
the retiring bell, and read us a lecture."</p>

<p>But Miss Ellingwood did not appear except
to say that Sarah would spend the night
with her, and that she wished everything to
be very quiet. Mabel and Ellen looked at
each other after she went out.</p>

<p>"What did I say?" said Mabel. "She'll
tell everything we do."</p>

<p>"We'll settle her," answered Ellen cheerfully.
"Oh, dear, to-morrow the grind begins!"</p>

<p>Sarah did not see the sun rise the next
morning, nor hear the first sounds of life in
the great building. She did not even stir at
the thunderous rising-bell. When she finally
woke, she saw Miss Ellingwood standing by
her bed.</p>

<p>"It's time to get up, Sarah."</p>

<p>Sarah rubbed her eyes.</p>

<p>"The rising-bell has rung, dear, and you'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
just have time to jump into my bathtub
and then get dressed quickly. Your things
are all here."</p>

<p>Sarah looked confusedly about her, while
she struggled out of bed.</p>

<p>"Did I stay here?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"All night?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did I oversleep myself?"</p>

<p>"No, you slept till just the proper time.
Now, run along."</p>

<p>It was a pleasure to see the bright eyes
and glowing cheeks with which Sarah presently
appeared. She had never seen a bathroom
like Miss Ellingwood's, she had never
smelled such soap or seen so many mysterious
brushes and sponges. She had been
a little frightened by the depth of the cool
water in the tub which Miss Ellingwood had
filled for her. She did not like to say that
she had never been in a bathtub before, because
Miss Ellingwood seemed to expect her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
to know all about bathtubs. Miss Ellingwood
had never lived on a farm.</p>

<p>Never before had Sarah dressed in such a
physical and mental glow. She tied the ribbon
on her hair just as the breakfast-bell
began to ring.</p>

<p>"Come here, and I'll button your dress
for you. I brought your school dress over.
You poor little chicken, did you think that
you would make a better impression on the
ogress if you put on a better dress? If the
girls bother you again, you must bring your
books over here. Now, come along."</p>

<p>Sarah drew a deep breath of delight. She
had never had such a good time. She looked
once more about the pretty room before the
door closed. Would she see it again? And
then Sarah's heart was guilty of a very
wicked wish.</p>

<p>"<em>Ach</em>, I wish," she said to herself, as
they went downstairs to breakfast, "I wish
those girls would cut always up so that I
could not study!"</p>

<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V <span class="subtit">PROFESSOR MINTURN'S EXPERIMENT</span></h2>

<p class="fp"><span class="smcap">It</span> needed no "cutting-up" of Sarah's room-mates
to send her again to Miss Ellingwood's
room. She had just settled fearfully to study
the next evening, when there was a rap at
the door, and Miss Ellingwood appeared.
She was amused at herself because her room
had seemed strangely lonely without the little
figure bending over the table at her side.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to bring your books
over to my room?" she asked; and Sarah
responded with delighted alacrity.</p>

<p>When Ellen and Mabel came in and found
that she had gone, they were not at all
pleased. They knew that Sarah had finished
her Geography lesson and they had hoped to
have some help. When they discovered the
neatly drawn maps in Sarah's drawer in the
table, they decided that they would do as well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll get even with her for tattling,"
laughed Mabel, as she prepared to copy
them with tissue paper and black impression
paper.</p>

<p>As the days passed, it seemed to Sarah
that she was living in a new world. When
she was not in class or in the gymnasium,
she was in Miss Ellingwood's room, or walking
with Miss Ellingwood. Miss Ellingwood
helped her over the hard places in her work,
she laughed at her mistakes in English, and
corrected them, she let Sarah help to serve
the tea when the boys and girls came in in
the afternoons.</p>

<p>The Juniors came oftenest; they were in
Miss Ellingwood's class, and as the time for
the giving of the "Christmas Carol" approached,
they were there constantly. Sarah
had read the story; she knew how old
Scrooge's sordid heart, devoted to money-getting,
was filled with the Christmas spirit
by the appearance of his dead partner, Jacob
Marley, and by the three ghosts of Christmas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Present, Christmas Past, and Christmas
Future. Ethel Davis and Gertrude Manley
were to be Mrs. Cratchit and Fred's wife,&mdash;they
were the leading women's parts. To
Sarah's thinking, there were no r&ocirc;les so interesting
as those of the ghosts, which were
taken by boys. Their costumes were so wonderful,
they moved about so mysteriously,
they were able to introduce so many original
devices. Perhaps next year, if she were promoted
to the Junior class, and if there were
a ghost in the play, Miss Ellingwood might
give the part to her, and then she would be
completely happy.</p>

<p>During the practicing, she took her books
into Miss Ellingwood's bedroom, and sitting
there at her work, she could hear the Juniors
laughing merrily. When it was time for the
tableaux, in which Scrooge was to see his
past and future, and all the harm he had
done in the present, they opened the door
into the bedroom, so that they might have a
double stage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>It was then that Edward Ellis, Dr. Ellis's
son, who was a Junior and represented
Jacob Marley, came and stood near Sarah's
table and recited his sepulchral part.</p>

<p>"'Expect the second spirit on the next
night at the same hour!'" he would say, while
his chains clanked and rattled, and the blood
of one hearer, at least, congealed in her
veins. "'The third upon the next night
when the last stroke of twelve has ceased to
vibrate. Look to see me no more; and look
that, for your own sake, you remember what
has passed between us.'"</p>

<p>And then, "the apparition walked backward,
and at every step it took, the window
raised itself a little, so that when the spectre
reached it, it was wide open."</p>

<p>Sarah had heard Miss Ellingwood read
the directions, and Edward obeyed them with
many ghostly variations. Once Sarah had
been called upon to lift the window by jerks
and starts.</p>

<p>In the midst of all the delightful excitement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of school life, Sarah often scolded herself
for not feeling perfectly happy and
contented. She was learning more than she
ever dreamed of learning, she had the constant
association of Miss Ellingwood, she
practically lived in Miss Ellingwood's luxurious
rooms. But she had no life outside them,
and it was that which troubled her. She realized
that there was a great deal of fun in
the school in which she had no share. There
were parades which appeared simultaneously
with the stroke of ten, beginning at the upper
corner of the woman's side of the great
building, and winding in and out the halls,
and down the stairways, like a long snake, to
the lower corner and back again. There were
feasts by day and night; there was dancing
in the gymnasium after the classes were over.
Sarah was not invited to the feasts, and she
looked on silently at the dancing. It was
true that she did not know how to dance,
but if stout Mabel Thorn could learn, she
could also, she was sure. She tried the steps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
sometimes when she was alone in Miss Ellingwood's
room.</p>

<p>Mabel and Ellen ignored her completely.
They did not always speak to her when she
came into the room. Once they allowed her
to search for her maps, which Ellen had been
tracing, and which she had hastily covered
with her papers. Gradually, the whole school
became aware that her room-mates avoided
her, and no one was clear-sighted enough to
see that it was a compliment to Sarah. When
Ellen and Mabel were called to the office
and reproved for making unnecessary noise,
they complained loudly that Sarah had reported
them, forgetting the many times that
Miss Jones had come upstairs in the middle
of the night to remonstrate with them. The
other students, even Ethel Davis and Gertrude
Manley, who thought they were just,
began to look a little askance at Sarah. No
fault is more hated by students than tale-bearing,
and no suspicion flies more quickly.</p>

<p>Ellen's and Mabel's rudeness did not trouble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Sarah. That did not seem worth worrying
about. It was her failure to make friends
with Ethel and Gertrude, and the other
Juniors whom she so admired, that troubled
her. Once she had called Ethel by her first
name, and Ethel had responded with a quick,
"What did you say, Miss Wenner?" She
had grown accustomed to having her teachers
call her Miss Wenner. But these boys
and girls,&mdash;that was different.</p>

<p>"At home," she said sorrowfully to herself,
"I was always common" (friendly); "and
here I am just the same. But these people
do not like it, they are too high up."</p>

<p>It could not be because she was a newcomer,
because they were gracious to other
newcomers. They called even the careless
girl who spilled her ink, Mary. They had
teas in their room to which only newcomers
were invited, but Sarah was not among them.
Sarah was convinced that it was some grave
fault in herself which made them avoid her.</p>

<p>Fortunately her work occupied most of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
her thoughts, and when that was over there
were always her letters home to be written.
She gave vivid, illustrated accounts of those
same feasts and parades at which she looked
longingly, and the home people never guessed
that it was a lonely outsider who described
them, sometimes in prose, sometimes in much-admired
jingle. She even described Ellen
dressed to represent William, as though it
were all a great joke, which she had enjoyed
immensely. She told about Edward Ellis's
wonderful "Bobs," a collie, who could spring
up to the low branches of the apple trees in
the fields at the back of the campus, and
who could perform many wonderful tricks.
She drew pictures of him, and of Professor
Minturn, who strode about the room while
he lectured, and of the Geography teacher,
who always folded his hands so precisely,
and sat so still.</p>

<p class="poem">"Sarah's so dumb,<br />
<span class="fp">It makes him numb,"</span></p>

<p class="fp">she wrote brilliantly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Laura and the twins wrote to her regularly,
the twins with wild, childish scrawls, which
hinted surprises at Christmas, and Laura with
funny accounts of her own difficulties.</p>

<p>"You should have seen my waffles last
evening," she would say. "They were black
on one side and a delicate buff on the other."</p>

<p>"Laura made waffles," the twins would
write. "William ate seven and we four."</p>

<p>Occasionally there would come a note in
William's clear hand.</p>

<p>"Enclosed find a little spending-money.
We hear that you are doing well. Be a good
girl."</p>

<p>It would have been a very ungrateful girl
who could have been <em>very</em> unhappy after
that.</p>

<p>There were Christmas surprises in her cupboard,
also. William's gifts of money had
been well spent. On the shelf above the secretary
at home, there had stood the battered
school-books and a worn copy of "Thaddeus
of Warsaw." Poor Thaddeus was to be overshadowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
henceforth by several well-bound
companions. There was "Westward Ho" for
William, and "Lorna Doone" for Laura, and
"Alice in Wonderland" for the twins, and
a fairy-book for Albert. Rarely does the approach
of Christmas find a person so entirely
satisfied with her gifts as Sarah was. But
Miss Ellingwood had selected them, and Miss
Ellingwood was infallible.</p>

<p>There was another present which she was
taking home. She had read halfway through
the upper shelf of Miss Ellingwood's story-books,
and she meant to remember them all,
and then during the vacation, she would sit
down before the fire after she had washed
the supper dishes, and she would take Albert
in her arms, and a twin would perch on each
side of her on the old settle, and they should
hear some stories that were stories.</p>

<p>She had become well acquainted with several
of the professors who came in to call on
Miss Ellingwood in the evenings. One was
Professor Minturn, for whom she had read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the paragraph of history on the first day of
school. He seemed to grow more nervous
each day, and more certain that his pupils
might do more work if they would.</p>

<p>"That sub-Junior and Junior History
might just as well be combined," he would
say irritably to Miss Ellingwood. "Then
they would finish the American History in
the sub-Junior year, and a thorough course
of General History could be divided between
the Junior and the Middle years. The present
arrangement is senseless."</p>

<p>One day he asked Sarah to remain after
class. The sub-Juniors looked at one another
and laughed. By this time, suspicion had
spread through the whole school.</p>

<p>"He probably wants to ask her whether
you and Ellen study your lessons," whispered
Mabel's neighbor.</p>

<p>Sarah was startled by the first question
which Professor Minturn addressed to her.</p>

<p>"Are you well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you ever been sick?"</p>

<p>"I had the measles and the mumps." This
sounded like the questions of the gymnasium
director. "And the whooping cough I had,
too."</p>

<p>"Do you take regular exercise?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You like to study, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I thought so. How should you like to do
a little extra work for me?"</p>

<p>All Sarah's life she had been doing extra
physical work. She had taken her mother's
duties gradually upon her shoulders as she
became ill; she had then taken a large part
of her father's work. But hitherto no one
had ever complimented her by asking her to
do extra study. Her cheeks glowed.</p>

<p>"I would like it very much."</p>

<p>"Very well," answered Professor Minturn,
beaming with satisfaction. "I wish you to
prepare eight pages of history instead of
four. Each day I shall ask you some questions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
after class." Professor Minturn smiled.
He thought that he had discovered a way of
trying a long-planned experiment.</p>

<p>The Geography teacher had long since
noticed that Sarah always knew her lessons.
One day he asked her in his precise way
whether she had been over the book before.</p>

<p>"No, sir. But I studied Geography with
my father, and it is not so hard for me like
it is for some people. I know what is in this
book."</p>

<p>The Geography teacher gave her a little
examination.</p>

<p>"Why, I believe you are ready for State
Board now. There isn't any reason why you
should waste your time with this class. How
would you like to come into the Physical
Geography class with the Juniors?"</p>

<p>Sarah gasped. That would bring her into
constant association with Ethel and Gertrude,
the objects of her devotion.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I am afraid I am too&mdash;too dumb,
<em>ach</em>, stupid, I mean."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>The teacher laughed. All Sarah's teachers
laughed at her more or less. It was only
yesterday that the gymnasium teacher had
laughed at her because she talked about
"planting the smallpox" when she meant
vaccinating.</p>

<p>"You aren't too stupid at all," the teacher
of Geography assured her. "To-morrow I'll
speak to Dr. Ellis about it. In the mean
time, you report with the Juniors."</p>

<p>Sarah's room-mates were not at all pleased
by her promotion. Hereafter there would be
no maps lying in her desk ready to be copied,
and their marks would be materially lowered.
They felt that her change of classes was a
personal grievance.</p>

<p>"No wonder that you get along," said
Ellen rudely. "You are what we call a
teacher's pet. The other evening I went to
Miss Ellingwood's room to get permission
to go downstairs, and the Latin teacher was
helping you. I don't think it is fair."</p>

<p>Sarah opened her mouth to speak, then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
closed it, flushing scarlet. The Latin teacher
did help her, but not with her regular lessons.
His helping her was a joke between
him and Miss Ellingwood. They had a great
many jokes together, many of which Sarah
did not understand. He said that he should
have to have some excuse for coming to see
Miss Ellingwood so often; he would pretend
that Sarah was his pupil. And so he used to
give her simple sight translations to read. It
was not part of her daily lesson; with that
of course he never helped her at all. It was
true that she studied her Latin grammar
very hard, so that she should be able to read
at sight for Mr. Sattarlee without very much
stumbling, and she paid all the more attention
to her daily lessons. But he did not
help her with them.</p>

<p>Ellen's remark seemed like an accusation
of dishonesty. But she did not explain, she
could not. It seemed like disloyalty to talk
about the Latin teacher and his coming to
Miss Ellingwood's room. He seemed to belong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
to Miss Ellingwood, and if she were
kind enough to allow Sarah to be there when
he came,&mdash;and he never came unless Sarah
was there,&mdash;it would be all the more contemptible
to talk to Ellen Ritter about it.
Sarah hunted through her drawer for a fresh
pencil and went back to Miss Ellingwood's
room. Her books had not been in her own
room for a month, nor had she slept there.</p>

<p>By this time Sarah had begun to think
that the curriculum was very carelessly
planned. She was even with the Juniors in
History and Physical Geography and Latin,
which were the three most difficult subjects
of the six which the Juniors had to pass.</p>

<p>She did not realize that she was growing
a little tired. She could scarcely keep her
eyes open until bedtime; it seemed to her
that the Juniors, busily practicing for their
play, or Mr. Sattarlee, calling upon Miss
Ellingwood, would never go. Gymnasium
had become more of a bore than ever. She
disliked it before because it was monotonous;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
now her step lagged in the marches and her
arms fell heavily in the drills because she
was tired.</p>

<p>She went walking less often with Miss
Ellingwood; Miss Ellingwood went with
Mr. Sattarlee. Miss Ellingwood had begun
to be a little absent-minded. Perhaps that
was the reason that she did not notice that
Sarah's cheeks had lost their ruddy color,
and that she no longer ran briskly down the
hall when she came from class.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when Miss Ellingwood was
away, Sarah opened the door and peered out
into the hall. Down in Gertrude's room there
was the sound of merry laughter. She and
Ethel were constantly inventing some new
entertainment. Once, when they had put up
a sign at the corner of the hall, notifying
the public that they meant that evening to
gratify a plebeian fondness for Bermuda
onions and bread and butter, Sarah almost
went to the feast. The notice begged all
those who liked onions to come, and warned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
all others to spend the evening with their
friends in distant parts of the building.
Sarah would cheerfully have eaten crow in
such company. But she did not dare to go.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI <span class="subtit">THE "CHRISTMAS CAROL"</span></h2>

<p class="fp"><span class="smcap">To</span> Sarah's surprise and delight, she had Miss
Ellingwood almost entirely to herself the day
of the play. Miss Ellingwood always prided
herself upon the absence of the mad rush
which is supposed to accompany and follow
the dress rehearsal. She was especially anxious
that this play should succeed, since it
was the first appearance of her class.</p>

<p>The dress rehearsal had been given the
night before. Sarah had watched it, entranced,
from the edge of the stage, where
she waited for possible errands. The Juniors
paid no attention to her, but she was too interested
to care. The extraordinary make-up
of old Scrooge, the mysterious gliding about
of the ghosts, the thrilling tableaux, directed
by Miss Ellingwood from behind the scenes,&mdash;Sarah
had never dreamed of anything like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
this. And it would be still more wonderful
the next night, from the front, when strange
green and purple lights were to follow the
ghosts about, and when there would be the
added excitement of a large audience. This
would be a story to tell the twins! But could
the twins be persuaded to believe such wonders?
Sarah sighed a little. She was going
home the day after the play, but it seemed
weeks ahead.</p>

<p>Miss Ellingwood slipped into the chapel
for a last look about before she started with
Sarah for a walk. She glanced over the properties,&mdash;Scrooge's
bowl of gruel, his candlestick,
the chains and money-boxes which
were to be rattled upon the approach of
Jacob Marley's ghost, the crutch for Tiny
Tim, the old clothes for Mrs. Dilber.</p>

<p>"It has all gone too smoothly," she said
to Sarah. "There hasn't been a hitch anywhere."</p>

<p>"I should think that would be good," said
Sarah.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Ellingwood shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, when things go so well at the rehearsal
they don't go so well afterwards,
usually. At any rate, nobody will be tired."</p>

<p>"The ghosts went skating," said Sarah.
"I saw them go off with their skates, and
take the car."</p>

<p>Miss Ellingwood frowned.</p>

<p>"That was a little risky." Then she ran
lightly down the steps. "But they'll be back.
Come on." She was only a little older than
the oldest pupil in her classes, and it was
difficult to be always grave and dignified.
Dr. Ellis watched her and smiled.</p>

<p>"I hope Miss Ellingwood's preparations
are all made," he said to his secretary.
"She's a fore-handed person."</p>

<p>The secretary looked up quizzically at the
sky. He was inclined to be pessimistic.</p>

<p>"The leading members of the cast have
gone out to the park to skate. They don't
run the cars when it snows."</p>

<p>Dr. Ellis also walked to the window and
looked out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Was Edward with them?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then they'll be back. Edward knows all
about the cars."</p>

<p>An hour later, Miss Ellingwood and Sarah
returned, laughing and covered with snow.
Miss Ellingwood glanced in at the office-door.</p>

<p>"Have the boys come?"</p>

<p>The secretary answered her.</p>

<p>"No. I shouldn't be surprised if they
didn't get here."</p>

<p>Some of the color faded from Miss Ellingwood's
rosy cheeks.</p>

<p>"But they <em>must</em>. What makes you say
that?"</p>

<p>"The cars don't run in snows like this."</p>

<p>"But they could get a carriage and drive."</p>

<p>The secretary shook his head dolefully.</p>

<p>"There aren't many houses out there."</p>

<p>"But they could walk."</p>

<p>"Not ten miles in this snow. Not in time,
anyway."</p>

<p>Miss Ellingwood spent the next hour looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
out of the window. The cars from the
park connected with the Normal School cars
at the square. At the end of the hour, when
darkness had fallen and no boys had appeared,
Miss Ellingwood slipped into the
dress which Sarah had laid out for her, and
ran down to the office. It was still snowing
heavily.</p>

<p>"They're not here?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Miss Ellingwood went toward the telephone-booth.
There was one way out of the
difficulty.</p>

<p>"I am going to telephone to the car-barn
and ask them to send out a car. It doesn't
make any difference what it costs."</p>

<p>The secretary threw out a crumb of comfort.</p>

<p>"Dr. Ellis attended to that, a few minutes
ago."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad!" cried Miss Ellingwood,
with a great rise of spirits. "Then
they'll certainly be here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>She ate her supper with a good appetite,
and then went up to the chapel.</p>

<p>Sarah dressed slowly. Ellen and Mabel,
having seen the flurry which preceded other
Junior plays, laughed scornfully. They did
not like Miss Ellingwood.</p>

<p>"It'll be a failure," declared Mabel. "I
could manage a play better." She looked
impertinently at Sarah. "Now don't you go
and tell her, Sarah."</p>

<p>Sarah did not answer. The walk had made
her tired. She meant to go early to the
chapel and take a book. Then she could get
a good seat, and could study her extra history
lesson until the play began.</p>

<p>She heard voices as she opened the chapel
door. She thought at first that some one
had mounted the stage for a final bit of
practice, then she saw that it was Miss Ellingwood.
Just in front of the stage stood
Dr. Ellis.</p>

<p>"I've had a telephone message, Miss
Ellingwood. They have tried to get a car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
out, but they say the snow is so soft and
heavy that they can't get out and back before
ten o'clock."</p>

<p>"Then my play is doomed!"</p>

<p>"Isn't there anything that can be done?"</p>

<p>The principal was much disturbed. He
prided himself upon the prompt performance
of all school exercises. In this case,
his own son helped to cause the failure.</p>

<p>"Nothing," answered Miss Ellingwood
helplessly. "They have the principal parts.
They're the play."</p>

<p>"Couldn't any one take their places?"</p>

<p>"No, not possibly. All the Junior boys
are in the tableaux, and anyhow, no one
knows the lines. I could do it myself, but
I have to direct behind the scenes. It is
hopeless."</p>

<p>"We'll have to postpone it till after
Christmas, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Miss Ellingwood sat down wearily on the
nearest chair.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't! All the spirit will have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
gone out of it. And it's a Christmas
play!"</p>

<p>"Then we will have to give it up."</p>

<p>Miss Ellingwood looked at him dismally.
Then her brows knitted. Could she take the
parts? Could they manage the tableaux
without her? It would make no difference
whether the ghosts were men or women.
Anything would be better than postponement.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she began slowly. "No, it
can't be done. I suppose a notice will have
to be put up on the door, and if you will
send Eugene for some of the boys, we will
straighten up the stage. The case is hopeless."</p>

<p>It was at this moment that little Sarah
Wenner appeared by the side of the tall
principal. Her cheeks were flushed, she
clasped her hands across the bosom of her
red dress.</p>

<p>"Is it anything I can do?" she asked.
"I know what the ghosts should say, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
where they should stand always. You begin
here, and then you wheel a little piece up
there and&mdash;<em>Ach</em>, I know it all by heart.
I heard them say it every evening when they
practiced. You said&mdash;you said&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the impulsive courage which had
prompted her speech had fled, her voice
failed, and she stood abashed, her face growing
scarlet.</p>

<p>It was several minutes before she dared to
look up. She expected that Miss Ellingwood
would reprove her sternly. She knew better
than to interrupt older persons like that, but
she had forgotten. She was always forgetting.
In one awful moment of forgetfulness
she had emptied a pitcher of water on Miss
Ellingwood's head. Her presumption in offering
overwhelmed her. They would think
that she was crazy. If she could only get
away, where she would not need to look up
and see the frowns on their faces.</p>

<p>"<em>Ach</em>," she began, "I do not know what
I am talking about. Sometimes I act so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
dumb. I&mdash;" She backed slowly away.
"I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly Miss Ellingwood was at her
side. She seized her arm, and held her for a
moment without speaking.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute." Then she looked up at
Dr. Ellis. "I believe&mdash;I believe it could be
done. Come, Sarah."</p>

<p>Dr. Ellis followed them behind the scenes.</p>

<p>"Is there anything I can do?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Postpone the ringing of the bell
till a quarter after eight. And send all the
Juniors here at once. Sarah, run up and get
into your gymnasium suit, and bring two
stiff petticoats and my long white wrapper,
and tell Ethel and Gertrude to come as fast
as they can. Go like a breeze, Sarah dear."</p>

<p>Sarah, in the character of Jacob Kalb
pursuing the twins, never moved faster.
Ethel and Gertrude, finishing their leisurely
dressing, watched her fly down the hall,
after she had summoned them.</p>

<p>"That wild youngster's in her gym suit,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
and has a lot of white stuff over her arm.
What can she be up to?"</p>

<p>"Hard to tell. Let's hurry."</p>

<p>When they clambered up to the stage,
having taken the short cut through the
chapel, they stood still, gaping.</p>

<p>Miss Ellingwood's cheeks were red, her
hair ruffled.</p>

<p>"Robert, you will have to read the part
of Marley's ghost from behind the scenes.
You'll have to speak as Edward did and
move about. I'll help you. And Sarah
knows the other parts. As the Ghost of
Christmas Past,&mdash;here, Sarah, is your tunic
and your golden belt." Miss Ellingwood
held up a handful of white and gold, digged
from the bottom of the property-box. "It's
really better to have a girl for this part.
Your hair must be down, there! and powdered,
and you must make your voice as
thin and clear as you can. As the Ghost of
Christmas Present, you will sit here on this
throne. We will have it turned this way, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
that there can be a prompter behind it. And
as the Ghost of Christmas Future, you will be
in black. Ethel and Gertrude will help you
dress, and there will be plenty of time. But oh,
Sarah, are you <em>sure</em> you know the parts?"</p>

<p>Sarah looked round at the circle of astonished,
doubting faces.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," she declared solemnly.
"Believe me, I do."</p>

<p>"Then get into your dress, quickly, and
then you and Scrooge go over there and go
over your parts. No, we'll do it here. If
anybody comes into the chapel, and overhears,
he'll just have to, that's all."</p>

<p>There were early comers, visitors from
town, who did not know that the hour had
been changed. They heard murmurs from behind
the curtain, but they laughed and talked
among themselves, and paid no heed.</p>

<p>The students did not appear until the bell
rang. They were thankful for the last moment
to finish a bit of packing or a visit.
There were no study-hours,&mdash;this was one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
of the great occasions of the year. They did
not know how narrowly they had missed
having any play at all, or how its success still
hung upon the slender thread of a small girl's
memory.</p>

<p>The cheerless, unpleasant room upon which
the curtain lifted gave no hint of the
Christmas spirit which already excited the
great school. Scrooge sat beside his table,
unshaven, wizened, clad in an old dressing-gown
and slippers, with a night-cap on his
head. He was eating a bowl of gruel, and at
the same time trying to identify the peculiar
substance of which it was made, and also to
keep the audience from suspecting that there
was anything the matter with it. When he
discovered that it was cotton, he made a resolve
of revenge upon the Junior girls who
had prepared it, which had nothing to do
with the play. It helped him, however, to
growl out maledictions upon the poor and
those who relieved their distress.</p>

<p>It was then that he was disturbed by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
clanking of chains and money-boxes, and the
voice of his old partner, Marley, was heard
faintly from behind the curtain which divided
the front and back of the stage. Marley reproved
him for his grasping, cruel spirit,
his sordid struggle for wealth, and Scrooge
cowered and listened in terror to the promise
of the ghost that he should be visited by
three others.</p>

<p>The curtain went down and rose almost
immediately. There had been only faint applause.
Scrooge had done his best, but the
ghost, speaking from behind the scenes, had
not the power to amuse and thrill which he
would have had if he had been able to appear.
Miss Ellingwood remembered, with a pang,
Edward Ellis's delightful vanishing through
the window.</p>

<p>Miss Ellingwood's face was pale. She realized
that the first scene had fallen flat.
And they were depending for the success of
the second upon little Sarah Wenner, who
had never even practiced with the rest of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
cast! It had been madness in Sarah to offer,
it had been worse than madness for Miss
Ellingwood to accept.</p>

<p>She peered out from behind the scenes,
her hand on Sarah's shoulder. Scrooge was
in bed, his night-cap tassel nodded from his
pillow. It was time for Sarah to go on. Directions
trembled on Miss Ellingwood's lips, but
she said nothing. It was too late now to
advise.</p>

<p>The light was dim, and the audience could
see nothing but the outlines of the old four-post
bed, and a faint, tiny, white figure,
which glided about, now slowly, now swiftly,
once with a dash of yellow light upon it,
once with a faint glow of purple. Her dress
was short, her feet were sandaled, she looked
even shorter than she was. The audience
gasped. They thought that Edward Ellis was
to play the part. Who was this sprite who
moved about so lightly? They leaned forward
breathlessly as the fairy thing approached
Scrooge's bed, and drew the curtain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
back. A trembling, faltering voice issued
from within.</p>

<p>"'Are you the spirit whose coming was
foretold me?'"</p>

<p>It seemed to Miss Ellingwood that long
moments passed before the answer came.
The child had never been on any stage in all
her life. Miss Ellingwood knew what stage
fright was. She was suffering from it now
herself. Then faintly but clearly came the
answer:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.'"</p>

<p>"'Long past?' inquired the trembling
Scrooge."</p>

<p>"'No, your past. Rise and come with
me.'"</p>

<p>The lights went out, there was the sound
of a great wind, then a wild cry which made
the timid clutch one another's hands.</p>

<p>"'I am afraid! I am afraid! I shall fall.'"</p>

<p>The clear voice answered, "'Bear but a
touch of my hand upon your heart, and you
shall be upheld in more than this.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>The curtain before the back of the stage
was lifted, the light came on slowly. There,
on the bench in an old-fashioned school-room,
sat a small boy, tired, homesick, forlorn.
To him entered a little girl, who threw
her arms about his neck and told him that
he was to come home. The little boy cried
happily, and there was a strange echo from
the front of the stage.</p>

<p>"'It is I!' cried Scrooge. 'I and my sister
Fanny.'"</p>

<p>"'And here?' said the spirit."</p>

<p>The curtain fell and at once was lifted.</p>

<p>"'My old master Fezziwig!' laughed
Scrooge."</p>

<p>The laugh died away at the next scene,
when he saw once more the girl whom he
had jilted because she was poor. A wild
horror was in his voice.</p>

<p>"'Leave me, spirit! I cannot bear it!'"</p>

<p>The spirit in the white dress and with the
streaming hair had already gone, and Scrooge
felt his way across the room to bed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>When the curtain went up again, it was
in a blaze of light. The bed-curtains were
closely drawn, and sitting upon the green
throne at the other end of the room was a
little figure in a long green robe. Even now
her schoolmates did not know her. She
laughed merrily as she called to Scrooge,
whose frightened face peered out from between
the curtains. It brightened at sight
of this cheerful ghost, but not for long.
The Ghost of Christmas Present had sad
sights to show.</p>

<p>The light faded, and though Christmas
bells rang merrily, one could not hear them
or enjoy them because of starved, wolfish
children living in misery, and poor Cratchit
and his family trying to make merry over
their goose, while want stared them in the
face. The audience sighed when the curtain
fell once more and Scrooge wandered about
his room alone.</p>

<p>By this time Miss Ellingwood had dropped
her book and was devoting her whole attention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
to the tableaux. They were saddest of
all now. Sarah was a tall figure without
shape. Miss Ellingwood had contrived a support
far above her head for the black robe.
The stage was almost dark, and Scrooge had
fallen upon his knees, as he watched the
scenes of future Christmases.</p>

<p>Tiny Tim, the Cratchit cripple, had died
from want of care, Scrooge himself lay in
the churchyard, hideous Mrs. Dilber and her
friends discussed his scant personal possessions,
and the vast amount of his wealth
went back into his business without ever
having profited a human soul.</p>

<p>The audience caught the spirit of Scrooge's
horror of himself, of his ecstatic joy at finding
that he was still alive, and that there
was time for him to redeem himself. They
laughed and applauded, and there were those
who cried. Then when the applause had died
down, there was a loud call for the ghosts.</p>

<p>"It sounds like Edward," said Miss Ellingwood.
"Run out and bow, Sarah."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>Sarah clutched Miss Ellingwood's dress.</p>

<p>"<em>Ach</em>, I cannot!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, you must."</p>

<p>In a second she found herself in the middle
of the stage. She saw the laughing, astonished
faces, she saw Dr. Ellis applauding,
she saw Professor Minturn smile, and
back against the wall four tall boys, the real
ghosts, who had come back at last. Near
them, there stood some one else, a little
taller than they, who waved his hand. It
was William; he had come to take her
home. Then her fright vanished. She was
not Sarah any more. She was the Christmas
Spirit, just as in the old days, when she
played with the twins, she had been Jacob
Kalb or Uncle Daniel or the Judge of the
Orphans' Court by turns.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas!" she cried, and then,
like Tiny Tim, "'God bless us, every one!'"</p>

<p>Mr. Sattarlee was back of the scenes when
she returned. He took both her hands in
his. It was as though she had saved the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
day for him, instead of for Miss Ellingwood.</p>

<p>"Everybody is coming over to my rooms
to have something to eat, Sarah, and of
course we want you."</p>

<p>Sarah smiled at him.</p>

<p>"I thank myself, <em>ach</em>, I mean I am much
obliged. But my brother is here, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We will have him too. We couldn't get
along without either of you."</p>

<p>Ethel and Gertrude each held out a grateful
hand. Even a tale-bearer must have her
due.</p>

<p>"You saved the play, Miss Wenner."</p>

<p>Sarah's happy little smile died away.</p>

<p>"<em>Ach</em>, no, ma'am."</p>

<p>But she could not be long unhappy. Miss
Ellingwood's hand would not let her go.
When William came he only said, "Why,
you little rascal!" which was praise enough.
He talked and laughed with Miss Ellingwood
and Mr. Sattarlee, and made friends
with the boys, until he grew more wonderful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
than ever in the eyes of his little sister. She
sat on the sofa beside Miss Ellingwood, and
Edward Ellis and the other ghosts told them
how they had walked home, despairing of
getting there in time, but determined to do
their best.</p>

<p>Ethel and Gertrude glanced at them, and
Ethel shrugged her shoulders lightly.</p>

<p>"How do you suppose she ever did it?"
said Gertrude.</p>

<p>A mocking smile came into Ethel's blue
eyes. It was well for Sarah that she did not
hear; it would have grieved her heart almost
as much as it hurt generous Ethel's to
say a thing so mean.</p>

<p>"Isn't it her usual occupation to listen
and tell?" asked Ethel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII <span class="subtit">SARAH SAVES THE DAY ONCE MORE</span></h2>

<p class="fp"><span class="smcap">The</span> fall term of school is a time of adjustment,
and the spring term flies so quickly
that it is hardly begun before it is over. It is
in winter that most real work is accomplished.
Then, too, when the days are short, and life
out of doors does not call so insistently, friendships
quicken and school spirit grows.</p>

<p>Sarah felt very much better after her return
from home. Laura had sternly forbidden
her to do any heavier work than drying dishes,
and looking after the twins and Albert, and
she had told stories to her heart's content,
and coasted and skated until she forgot that
a grammar or a geography ever existed.</p>

<p>Now she worked diligently. It is safe to
say that never had one small girl learned so
much in so short a time. Professor Minturn
was delighted with her progress; he regarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
his theory that the sub-Junior and the Junior
History could be combined as already proved.
The Geography professor cheered her enthusiastically
on. He had meant to speak to Dr.
Ellis about her transference from one class
to the other, but he had forgotten it, and
Sarah proceeded undisturbed. Mr. Sattarlee
continued to have her read at sight for him
in the evenings. He had begun to be really
interested in seeing how much she could do.</p>

<p>Class rivalry always came to a head at the
annual gymnasium exhibition, which took
place just before the close of the winter term.
There were performances by individuals, elaborate
swinging of clubs and heavy work of
various kinds, Gilbert dancing and intricate
drills. The class which made the best record
was given a silver cup.</p>

<p>Hitherto the cup had always been won by
the Middle or the Senior class. Each year the
enthusiastic Juniors made a frantic effort and
failed. Occasionally they excelled in individual
work, but the other classes had the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
advantage of longer team-work in the drills.
This year the Senior class was weak, and the
Juniors would have had some hope, had it
not been that the Middlers were exceptionally
strong.</p>

<p>By this time the glow which followed the
Christmas vacation was gone, and Sarah was
once more a very tired girl. She had looked
forward to the entertainment for weeks, but
now that it was at hand, she wished with all
her heart that she could go to bed instead of
attending it.</p>

<p>The sub-Junior girls gave only an elementary
wand-drill at the opening of the exhibition.
The audience was still gathering;
they formed merely the inconspicuous orchestra
before the beginning of the real performance.
When the drill was over, Sarah was
glad to climb the steps to the running-track,
and look down sleepily over the crowd in
search of Miss Ellingwood.</p>

<p>The floor of the great gymnasium was divided
into two parts. One was left bare for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the exhibition; the other was covered by a
steep tier of seats occupied by the invited
guests of the faculty and the faculty themselves.
The students, when they were not at
work, watched from the wide running-track
which circled the gymnasium. Its railing was
gayly decked with school and class banners,
and it was crowded with close-packed groups
of enthusiastic boys and girls. Far above in
the dusk, showed dimly the great beams
which upheld the vaulted roof.</p>

<p>Presently Sarah found Miss Ellingwood,
sitting almost beneath her, with Mr. Sattarlee
by her side. Then Sarah grew more and
more sleepy. She heard the girls of her own
class whispering round her. Mabel and Ellen
were near by, but she did not turn her head,
which rested comfortably against one of the
upright supports of the great beam.</p>

<p>Below on the floor the girls of the Middle
class were beginning an elaborate swinging
of Indian clubs, moving in such perfect time
with the music and with one another that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the difficult task seemed the easiest in the
world. Already the girls of the Junior class,
who were to follow, were quietly slipping
down the stairs. Sarah saw them dimly, Ethel
and Gertrude and all the others whom she so
admired, and who paid no attention to her.
The fact that she had saved their class play
seemed to make them not more but even less
friendly. The tears came into her eyes, and
she brushed them angrily away. What a
goose she was! She tightened her hold a little
on the upright iron, and leaned her head
against it once more. If she could only go
over to the Main Building and go to bed!</p>

<p>Then suddenly she awoke. It seemed to
her at first that she heard the cheering in
her sleep; then it grew to a great roar all
about her. The sub-Juniors beside her were
cheering, the group of boys of the Middle
class on the opposite side of the running-track
were yelling madly, and "Bobs,"
Edward Ellis's collie, who would not be left
at home, was barking as though he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
burst his throat. Sarah made out the Middle
class yell:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"Hip, hip, hooray,<br />
<span class="fp">Scarlet and gray,<br />
We win the day!"</span></p>

<p class="fp">Then, looking up, she saw the cause of the
excitement. Floating proudly from the great
central beam, far above her head, was the
scarlet and gray banner of the Middle class.
The banner must have been rolled up and
fastened there by some adventurous climber,
and a cord by which it could be unfurled
carried down along the supports to the opposite
side of the running-track. It was no
wonder that the Middlers had insisted upon
having that particular spot. The cord had
unfastened itself properly, and the great flag
was left free to float back and forth in the
slight breeze which came in round the many
tall windows.</p>

<p>There was a wild yell from the Junior
class, not of delight, but of disgust and dismay,
and "Bobs" changed his bark to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
howl. The trick was a clever one, and it did
not add to the comfort of the Juniors to
realize that there was nothing to be done.
The next number on the programme was
a minuet by the Junior girls. They would
have to give it, alas, under the colors of
their rivals.</p>

<p>Edward Ellis and half a dozen others tried
to push their way through the close-packed
ranks of the Middlers, but Dr. Ellis saw
them and motioned them back. Meanwhile
the Middler girls went quietly on, not losing
a beat of their time. When they finished,
they marched out amid loud cheers and clapping
of hands.</p>

<p>The sub-Juniors round Sarah were dancing
up and down. Traditionally they were
the friends of the Middle class, and the
Middle class itself did not enjoy the sight
of the great banner as much as they.</p>

<p>"Won't the Juniors be furious?" laughed
Ellen Ritter. "I can just see Ethel Davis
and Gertrude Manley when they behold it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
And they can't do a thing. Good for
'em!"</p>

<p>And the sub-Juniors moved a little farther
down the running-track, crowding the
Seniors behind them, so that they could
see the faces of the Junior girls when they
caught the first glimpse of the scarlet
flag.</p>

<p>The same flame leaped suddenly in Sarah's
heart that had flared before she pursued
Jacob Kalb with a gun, and before she had
poured the water out through the transom.
But this time she deliberated and laid her
plans more slowly. She owed the members
of her own class no loyalty.</p>

<p>She looked up at the great beam far above
her head. She tried to shake the iron upright
upon which her hand rested and found
it as firm as the boards beneath her feet;
then she stared up again at the beam and
down at the floor far below, and her eyes
brightened.</p>

<p>There was a Junior flag just under her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
hand. The Junior class would enter in the
dark, the lights were to be entirely extinguished,
so that they could slip to their
places without being seen, and then the light
would come, not from the electric globes,
but from a stereopticon lantern at the end
of the room, which would throw colored
lights upon the performers. Sarah knew all
the arrangements. Already the gymnasium
director had risen to announce that the lights
would be turned out, and that no one should
be alarmed.</p>

<p>Sarah glanced about once more. It was
fortunate that she was just above the entrance
to the dressing-room, and in the most
undesirable place on the track. There was
no one within ten feet. She put her hand on
the belt of her gymnasium suit to be sure
that the buttons were all tight and that nothing
should hamper her, and then she
thought of the tall hickory tree at home,
up which she had scrambled ever since she
could remember, and smiled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>The row of lights above the running-track
faded and went out, and she put her arms
round the slender iron pole. Then those below
were darkened, and with a spring her
rubber-soled feet were on the railing. When
she felt the great beam, she had one moment
of awful fright. What if they should suddenly
turn on the lights and she be discovered
hanging in mid-air? She would not be
able to keep her hold. There would be one
agonized moment, then she would drop down,
down to the floor beneath.</p>

<p>But the fright did not make her stop. It
vanished completely when she felt under her
hands the cord which fastened the flag.</p>

<p>She did not attempt to untie it, there was
no time for that. There were two pins on
the front of her blouse, which had fastened
on the sub-Junior badge which she had worn
during her own drill. Wrapping the Middler
flag round the beam, so that it was completely
hidden, she pinned the Junior flag to
its edge, and then crept slowly back. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
could see far below her the line of dim white
figures crossing the gymnasium. In another
instant they would be in their places, and
then the lights would flare out.</p>

<p>Thankfully she felt the iron pole beneath
her feet, and in wild panic slid down, the
iron burning her hands like steam. Then
she stood holding desperately to it, panting.</p>

<p>It was the man who managed the stereopticon
who revealed the new banner. The
Junior girls in their white dresses wove back
and forth in intricate figures, now in the
gleam of violet, now in the glow of rose-color.
Now they spread out from one end of
the wide floor to the other, now they were
close together. Presently there was a glow
of yellow light which illuminated the whole
gymnasium and rested especially upon the
high beam. The stereopticon man had no
sympathy with any particular class. He realized
that the scarlet and gray flag was an
object of interest, so he trained his light<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
upon it. Every eye in the gymnasium was
lifted at once.</p>

<p>Bedlam broke loose, after an instant's
pause, during which faculty and students
and guests stared open-mouthed. Where was
the Middler banner? Who had dared to climb
out there and remove it? And who had
hung the Junior banner there?</p>

<p class="poem">"Light blue and white,<br />
<span class="fp">We're all right!"</span></p>

<p class="fp">roared the Junior boys.</p>

<p>"Wow, wow, wo-o-ow," howled "Bobs."</p>

<p>"Bang, bang, bang," played the pianist,
in a noble effort to be heard above the din.
Only the Junior girls seemed undisturbed.
They wove more intricate evolutions, deaf to
the piano as they were; their powdered heads
bowed to one another, their motion seemed
to grow more light and fairy-like. Presently
one of them glanced upward, then another,
and some one smiled faintly, and without another
sign, they went on with more spirit
than ever.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>A Middler started at once to climb the
pole, but was ordered back. Then another
tried it, and was sternly reproved. The flag
must hang there now, there would be no
more seasons of convenient darkness in which
it might be torn down. The Junior girls
marched out, Ethel Davis and Gertrude Manley
leading, as they led most affairs in their
class.</p>

<p>Now it was the turn of the Middler boys
to take a taste of their own medicine, and
give their drill under a rival banner. They
gritted their teeth angrily. The displacement
of their flag disturbed them sorely. The
cup was theirs already, they were sure of
that, but the celebration with which they
meant to mark their victory was spoiled.</p>

<p>Anger may be a spur in a long jump or
in putting the shot, but it does not conduce
to good team-work. One of the Middlers
lifted his clubs too swiftly, another too
slowly, and they did not begin in good form.
And then there was the click of club<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
against club, an evidence of carelessness
of which not even the sub-Juniors would be
guilty.</p>

<p>A giggle spread along the line of the
Juniors. The audience heard and the Middlers
themselves heard, and their faces grew
hot and their hands unsteady. There was
a bang, a crash, and an Indian club flew in
a wide curve, and sailed through the glass
door which opened into the director's office.
It was an unpardonable crime.</p>

<p>"Attention!" cried the director. "Clubs
at rest, right face, march."</p>

<p>For the first time in the history of the
school a Middle class had failed, and the
Juniors had won the cup.</p>

<p>Sarah had slipped to the rear of the group
of her classmates. She was desperately tired,
and her hands burned like fire. If she could
only go to bed! But no one was expected
to leave until the end. It seemed to her that
minutes lengthened into hours and still the
entertainment dragged on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>All round her she heard excited inquiry.
What Junior had crept out on the beam?
Was it Edward Ellis?</p>

<p>"You didn't see a Junior go up this side,
did you, Sarah?" asked Mabel Thorn; and
Sarah answered with a truthful and weary
"No."</p>

<p>She had sat down on the edge of a springboard,
she did not hear even the loud cheering
which followed the handing of the cup to
the Junior president. There was a rush for
the stairs, and she was carried on unresisting.
Then she slipped aside and opened the door
leading to the lower floor. From there a narrow
passageway ran between the swimming-pool
and the girls' dressing-room and thence
led out of doors. The main exit was jammed
with arguing, cheering students; she could
not go out that way.</p>

<p>As she passed the door of the girls' dressing-room,
she heard the same excited questions
shouted back and forth. Ethel and
Gertrude were laughing and talking as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
struggled out of their long cheese-cloth
dresses. Suddenly one of them called to
her:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who are you, out there? Suppose you
come in and untangle me!"</p>

<p>Sarah knew well enough that if they had
known it was she they would not have called
her. Nevertheless, she went in and asked
what she could do.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Gertrude, "is it you, Miss
Wenner? Please unpin this down the back."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," answered Sarah.</p>

<p>She could scarcely open her hand; it felt
as though there were not a fragment of skin
left on the palm, but she struggled bravely
with the stubborn pins. It seemed to her a
long time until she was able to extract the
first one.</p>

<p>"There is one out already," she said
faintly.</p>

<p>Ethel turned to look at her and then came
a little closer.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Look at me, child!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
The word slipped out involuntarily, and she
corrected herself at once. "Miss Wenner,
what is the matter? Let me see your hand."
And Ethel seized it and pointed to the white
dress. There was a slow-spreading, scarlet
stain on it.</p>

<p>"No," cried Sarah. "Leave me go. It is
nothing. I&mdash;I just skinned myself a little.
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ethel firmly opened her fingers. Then
Gertrude looked at her other hand. It too
was bleeding.</p>

<p>Sarah tried to pull her hands away.</p>

<p>"<em>Ach</em>, it is nothing. Leave me be!"</p>

<p>"It looks to me&mdash;" began Ethel slowly.</p>

<p>"As though you had been sliding down
the pole in the gym," finished Gertrude.</p>

<p>"I skinned my hand there once before I
learned how," said Ethel. "But the gym
hasn't been open for practice to-day, and this
has just been done. How did you do it?"</p>

<p>Sarah had lost all power to struggle.</p>

<p>"<em>Ach</em>, it is nothing!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>Gertrude gasped.</p>

<p>"Did you climb up that pole and put our
flag on the beam?"</p>

<p>"Answer her, please," commanded Ethel.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because&mdash;<em>Ach</em>, leave me
go!"</p>

<p>The great low-ceiled locker-room was growing
dim. Sarah tried to jerk away. This time
it was not embarrassment but terror which
gave her strength.</p>

<p>"You haven't any business to talk to me
like this. I did it because I didn't want to
see you drill under that other flag. I hate
that other flag. And I hate&mdash;" Sarah took
a deep breath. Her heart felt like a hard
lump in her breast. There was a red flaming
light before her eyes,&mdash;"I hate <em>you</em>!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII <span class="subtit">THE RESULT OF PROFESSOR MINTURN'S<br />
EXPERIMENT</span></h2>

<p class="fp"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a long time before either Ethel or
Gertrude answered. They had not been more
surprised at sight of the Junior banner above
their heads. They were both accustomed to
being liked, not hated.</p>

<p>"What makes you say that?" asked
Ethel.</p>

<p>Her cheeks were hot. Sarah's climbing to
the roof of the gymnasium was not in accord
with the character which she bore in the
school. Certainly that was not the way to
please teachers, or to win their favor for herself.</p>

<p>Sarah's voice shook. She did not feel the
pain in her hands. The lights had gone out,
and they seemed to be alone in the locker-room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because I meant it." Then good English
flew to the winds. "You are all the time
cross over me. You are too high up. I am
dumb and I can't always talk right, and I
come from Spring Grove post-office, but
I don't do <em>you</em> anything. I never did you
anything. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was the spurt of a match, and Gertrude
lit the gas. Then she laid her hands on
Sarah's shoulders and turned her to the light.
Her voice trembled also.</p>

<p>"Look here. You've been frank, and I
shall, too. Did you ever report your room-mates
for making a noise?"</p>

<p>"No." The answer was explosive.</p>

<p>"Do you tell Miss Ellingwood everything
that you can find out?"</p>

<p>Sarah laughed hysterically. "I don't find
out anything to tell her. How should I?"</p>

<p>"Did you never tell her about your room-mates?"</p>

<p>"I never say nothing from them at all to
nobody. I leave them alone. But they won't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
leave me alone. They made me throw water
on Miss Ellingwood, they made me&mdash;" She
looked about so wildly that the girls were
frightened.</p>

<p>Gertrude put a steadying arm round her.</p>

<p>"You were right. We have been mean."</p>

<p>Sarah looked at her piteously. "<em>Ach</em>, I&mdash;I
shouldn't have talked so. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ethel looked gravely into Gertrude's eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, you should," she said to Sarah.
"Now, come over to our room and I'll tie
up your hands for you. You mustn't tell
anybody that it was you that slid down the
pole."</p>

<p>"No, ma'am. I wish I could go in my bed.
If I don't go in my bed, I won't know my
lessons for to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You shall go to bed."</p>

<p>But Miss Ellingwood's room was crowded
with guests, and there was the sound of many
voices in Sarah's.</p>

<p>"It is no place I can sleep," she cried.</p>

<p>The pain in her hands had come back, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
made her feel faint. It seemed to her that
she should die if she could not sleep.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is," said Ethel and Gertrude
together.</p>

<p>And so with peaceful heart and bandaged
hands, Sarah slept in Ethel's bed, while Ethel
and Gertrude whispered together across the
room.</p>

<p>"It was in the air," said Ethel. "Everybody
distrusted her."</p>

<p>Gertrude sat up in bed. "I think we've
been hateful, <em>hateful</em>," she said. "Listen!"</p>

<p>"Some people always talk in their sleep,"
answered Ethel. "I guess she's tired, poor
child. I'm not sleepy, are you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Gertrude, "I'm ashamed. Are
you?"</p>

<p>Following the gymnasium entertainment
came a few days of examinations, then a day
of hurried packing, before the scattering of
five hundred boys and girls to their homes
for a week. Sarah was to go home; she had
been thinking for a long time of the snowdrops<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
which would be in bloom on the
south side of the house, and the daffodils
which must be poking up through the earth.
But now at the last moment, she did not
seem to care. If they would only let her
go to bed and sleep and sleep! She feared
that some day she might drop over asleep
where she stood, and frighten Miss Ellingwood
and Ethel and Gertrude. How absurd
it would be to fall asleep in the middle of
the day! Mabel Thorn and Ellen Ritter
often took naps after dinner, but Sarah had
not slept in the daytime since she was a
baby.</p>

<p>If she had been a little older or a little
less forgiving, she might have been slower
to accept the friendship of Ethel and Gertrude,
offered at once in many penitent and
friendly ways. But almost immediately the
hardness went out of her heart and the tremor
from her voice when she saw them or
spoke to them. Finally she felt the same
soft, happy thrill of relief that she had felt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
when Aunt 'Liza appeared with her gift of
cake and <i>schnitz</i>.</p>

<p>"Nobody is cross over me, and I am not
cross over anybody," she said to herself.</p>

<p>And in a day or two she did tumble over
as she had feared. Ethel and Gertrude were
waiting for her on the steps. She was going
with them to the shop to order viands for a
feast to be held in their room that evening.
Miss Ellingwood had gone walking, and
Sarah grew heated and impatient over the
fastening of her sailor suit, and the tying
of her red scarf.</p>

<p>She did not wait for the elevator, but
ran downstairs, jumping over the last step of
each flight, and then going more sedately out
past the office door. She remembered afterwards
that she had felt a little dizzy, and
that she had once put out her hand to steady
herself. She saw Professor Minturn coming
toward her on his way to the faculty meeting
in the office, and she tried to straighten
up and bow to him. Instead, she pitched forward
at his feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>In one step, Professor Minturn was beside
her. He expected to see her scramble up,
red-faced and embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope you haven't hurt yourself!"
he began to say.</p>

<p>But Sarah did not move.</p>

<p>"Miss Wenner!" he said, in a tone which
brought Dr. Ellis and the Secretary and Eugene
hurrying from the office. By that time,
he had lifted her from the floor.</p>

<p>"She seems to have fainted," he said.</p>

<p>Dr. Ellis swept a pile of catalogues from
the office-sofa.</p>

<p>"Lay her down there, Minturn. Eugene,
get some water."</p>

<p>The color was coming back faintly to
Sarah's cheeks when Miss Ellingwood walked
in. Then it vanished once more, and she
lay limp and deadly white.</p>

<p>"Telephone for Dr. Brownlee," commanded
Dr. Ellis. "Ah, there, she's opening her
eyes. Look here, Sarah!"</p>

<p>Sarah smiled faintly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>
<div class="image">
<div class="figcenter"><a name="image146"><img src="images/image146.jpg" alt="Illustration: SHE SEEMS TO HAVE FAINTED" width="500" height="720" /></a></div>
<div class="caption">SHE SEEMS TO HAVE FAINTED</div>
</div>

<p class="space-above">"I feel so&mdash;so&mdash;queer," she whispered.
"I would like to go in my bed."</p>

<p>"You shall," Dr. Ellis assured her. "Eugene,
do you think you can carry her upstairs?"</p>

<p>Professor Minturn held out his arms. He
was frowning; he felt suddenly a great anxiety
and uneasiness. But he was sure that he
had asked the child whether she was well;
he could not have been so careless as to give
her extra work without ascertaining that.
She had always looked strong. He could not
believe that this pale child could be that
same rosy-cheeked little girl who had worked
with such spirit.</p>

<p>"Let me take her upstairs," he said nervously.</p>

<p>By the time he returned, Dr. Brownlee
was coming in at the front door.</p>

<p>"You'll come down and tell us at once
how she is and what is the matter, doctor?"
he said. "She's a favorite pupil of mine."</p>

<p>Then he went in and took his seat by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
window in the faculty room, among his colleagues
who were waiting for him, and the
meeting was called to order.</p>

<p>Dr. Brownlee tapped at the door before
the business was fairly begun.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said. "I thought
I could get back before your meeting was
in session."</p>

<p>"Come in," invited Dr. Ellis. "How is
your patient? What is the trouble?"</p>

<p>Dr. Brownlee's answer was prompt and
to the point.</p>

<p>"Overstudy."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" answered Dr. Ellis just
as promptly. "She is a sub-Junior, and the
sub-Junior branches are not hard, and she
is a bright girl and was well prepared."</p>

<p>Dr. Brownlee did not like to be contradicted.</p>

<p>"She's been talking incoherently about
extra history and extra geography and extra
something else. I don't remember what the
other is. She doesn't look like a girl who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
should have any extras of any kind. At least
not now. I don't know what she looked like
when she came here."</p>

<p>"She looked like a strong, healthy country
girl. She was slender, but she looked
well. She has had regular exercise in the
gymnasium, and she hasn't had any extra
work to do, I am positive."</p>

<p>Professor Minturn rose suddenly.</p>

<p>"I have always had a theory that the
sub-Junior and the Junior History could be
advantageously combined. I thought Miss
Wenner was a good subject upon whom to
try it. I see now that I was wrong." And
he sat down and stared out the window.</p>

<p>The teacher of Geography got more
slowly to his feet.</p>

<p>"I meant to report to you, Dr. Ellis, but
I forgot it, that Miss Wenner had been taking
the Junior Geography. She was considerably
ahead of the sub-Junior class, and so
I allowed her to begin the Physical Geography,
and perhaps she has been going a&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
little faster than the&mdash;the rest of the class.
She was so enthusiastic, it was a pleasure to
teach her. I&mdash;I have never had a pupil like
her."</p>

<p>Dr. Ellis smiled queerly.</p>

<p>"Are there any more confessions to be
made?"</p>

<p>Young Mr. Sattarlee rose from his place
at the back of the room. He did not look
at Dr. Ellis, or at any of his colleagues, but
stared straight over their heads. There was
no one in the room who did not know of his
devotion to Miss Ellingwood, and Sarah's
constant association with her.</p>

<p>"She has been reading a little Latin at
sight for me," he said. "She did it very
well."</p>

<p>"She seems to have done very well for
all of you," said Dr. Ellis grimly. "I wish
that I could feel that we had done as well
by her."</p>

<p>Dr. Brownlee stood motionless at the door.
He was polite enough not to say, "I told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
you so," though restraining himself must
have cost considerable effort.</p>

<p>"Put her to bed at once over in the Infirmary
where it's quiet," he commanded.
"I'll see the nurse. And keep her there
for two weeks. Then, if she goes slowly for
the rest of the year, doing only her own
regular work, and that as easily as possible,
she'll get through without any injury to
herself. Don't let her go home for the vacation.
She isn't fit for the journey or the
excitement of seeing people. I'll be down
to-morrow morning again. Good-by."</p>

<p>At first Sarah lay very still and stared at
the infirmary ceiling. She did not remember
being carried thither, and it seemed to her
that she spent days in trying to realize where
she was. She remembered afterwards that
she was constantly disturbed by a person in
a white dress who insisted that she must eat
and drink when she did not wish to eat and
drink.</p>

<p>"It is very good," the person in white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
would say coaxingly, and Sarah would rejoin
politely but a little wearily,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is it so? Then won't you please eat it?
I don't want to eat."</p>

<p>But all her protestations made no difference;
the hot broth or cold milk was poured
down her throat.</p>

<p>Once a tall man spent several hours by
her bed, and fed her and held her hand and
was very strong and comforting. After he
had gone she said to the nurse, as though
she had made a great discovery, "Why, that
was William!" and the nurse laughed and
said, "Yes."</p>

<p>Slowly she began to distinguish other
faces, those of three repentant professors,
who brought her flowers and sent her fruit
and squab, and Miss Ellingwood, equally repentant
and even more attentive, who made
Sarah proud by whispering to her that she
was going to marry Mr. Sattarlee, and that
no one but Sarah was to know it until school
was over.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently Ethel and Gertrude came, one
at a time, and one day, after she was sitting
up, Edward Ellis, with his mother and an
armful of flowers.</p>

<p>"I never knew that being sick was like
this!" she said to her nurse.</p>

<p>"It isn't for everybody," answered the
nurse, smiling.</p>

<p>At the end of two weeks she was allowed
to get up, and even to study a little. Every
one was anxious to help her. Eugene sprang
to take her up in the elevator, even though
it was not elevator hours, and Mabel and
Ellen said awkwardly that if she would come
back and sleep in her own room they would
be very quiet. Fortunately, they made the
offer before Miss Ellingwood, who said at
once that she could not spare Sarah. It was
amazing how the sentiment of the school had
changed during her illness.</p>

<p>Dr. Ellis stopped her and spoke to her
whenever he met her in the hall, and one
day he asked her to come into his office.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sarah," he said, "I had a talk with
your brother about you, and what he told
me made me very proud to have you here,
and more sorry than ever that between us
we should have let you get sick. Now
every Monday morning I want you to
come in and report to me how you feel.
No, we'd better make it Friday evening.
One is most apt to be tired on Friday
evening. And Sarah,"&mdash;he smiled at the
sudden flush of frightened color,&mdash;"you
won't climb any more gymnasium beams,
will you?"</p>

<p>Sarah clasped her hands.</p>

<p>"<em>Ach</em>, no! I&mdash;I was up before I thought.
That is the trouble with me. I do things
before I think always. I&mdash;I promise."</p>

<p>She went out of the office with her old
swift step. She felt almost entirely well
physically. Mentally, she seemed a stranger
to herself. Her illness, her watching Miss
Ellingwood's happiness, her association with
the older girls, made her feel grown up. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
was homesick for the twins and Albert and
the farm and her old, childish self.</p>

<p>The solicitude of the professors was amusing
to see.</p>

<p>"You have been over the year's work,"
Professor Minturn reminded her. "Now you
will have to do only a little reviewing, just
a little each day, Sarah." It was strange
how to faculty and girls alike she had become
Sarah instead of Miss Wenner. "You
needn't come to class regularly. You can
spend that time in study, and I will give
you a shorter recitation by yourself."</p>

<p>"<em>Ach</em>, no, I thank you!" cried Sarah. It
was only under special stress of surprise or
gratitude that she said <em>ach</em> now. "I will
come to class, thank you."</p>

<p>The Geography teacher said that he would
go over all the Political Geography with her,
and Mr. Sattarlee did not say a word to Miss
Ellingwood in the evenings until he had
heard Sarah's Latin lesson for the next day.
It must have been a good deal of a sacrifice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
for they had many things to say to each
other.</p>

<p>And day by day the spring passed. The
maples on the campus budded and burst into
full leaf, the oaks and hickories followed
more slowly. The air was full of the song
of birds and the scent of flowers, and slowly
the ruddy color came back to Sarah's cheeks
to stay.</p>

<p>But she was strangely nervous. Each
hour that brought home and summer nearer
brought also the dreaded ordeal of State
Board examinations a little closer. One might
study faithfully through the year, and pass
the faculty examinations brilliantly, and one's
efforts count for nothing unless the state also
put its seal upon the results. And Sarah became
each day more certain that she should
not pass.</p>

<p>"It's exactly like a funeral," wailed Ethel
Davis. "They come on Wednesday night,
seven of them, county superintendents and
Normal School principals, and the next<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
morning they begin to examine us, and in the
afternoon they examine us again, and then
they give us ice-cream for supper when nobody
has any appetite for ice-cream, and in
the evening sometimes there are left-over
examinations, and then we spend the whole
night worrying for fear we haven't passed,
and they spend the whole of the next day
correcting papers,&mdash;I'm always glad when
it's sweltering hot!&mdash;and then they insult
us by giving us more ice-cream for supper,
and then we go into the chapel to hear
whether we have passed."</p>

<p>"I won't pass," said Sarah in despair.
"I can't pass."</p>

<p>Ethel laughed.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Of course you'll pass, child.
Why, you have only Spelling and Political
Geography and Arithmetic and Physiology
to pass. And you always know your Spelling,
and you're ahead in Geography. You
are a little gosling. Now suppose you had
six branches, Latin and History and Physical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Geography and Grammar and Drawing
and Civil Government. What would you do
then, young lady?"</p>

<p>"I should die," said Sarah solemnly.</p>

<p>"But you'll have them next year."</p>

<p>"No," answered Sarah. "I do not believe
I will be here next year. The twins must
soon have their chance. I cannot take two
years to one class. And if they did let me
come back, I would be taking Arithmetic
and Spelling and Geography and Physiology
over again, and you and Gertrude would be
two classes ahead of me. That is the way it
would be."</p>

<p>Ethel looked at her sharply.</p>

<p>"You come out for a walk," she said
cheerfully; and she took Sarah's books almost
by force. She and Gertrude had had
a talk with Dr. Ellis, and no dragons could
have insisted more firmly than they upon
the carrying out of both the letter and the
spirit of Dr. Brownlee's directions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX <span class="subtit">THE STATE BOARD</span></h2>

<p class="fp"><span class="smcap">There</span> was a tradition that the day of the
State Board examinations was always fair.
This year it was not to be belied. Sarah,
who had been awake since before daylight,
watched the sun rise, clear and bright, as
she dressed. Miss Ellingwood slept peacefully
in her room next door, and the morning
sweeping and dusting in the halls had
not yet begun when Sarah sat down on the
window-seat with a pile of books before her.
There were a dozen things at which she
wished to take a final look. Even her confidence
in the Wenner ability to spell had vanished
under the strain of the last months,
and she meant to glance rapidly through at
least half the book. The thought of Arithmetic
plunged her into despair; there was
no use in trying to review that. But she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
could take a final look at the Geography and
the Physiology.</p>

<p>Then, strange to say, she did nothing but
sit still and look out over the dewy campus
until it was time to go to breakfast.</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" asked Miss Ellingwood.</p>

<p>"Scared," answered Sarah, trying to smile.</p>

<p>The members of the Board breakfasted at
the Secretary's table, which was next to Miss
Ellingwood's. Sarah, who could not keep her
eyes away from them, felt that there was a
terrible menace in the way they laughed and
joked with one another. Only exceedingly
hard-hearted persons could laugh that way
just before they assisted in such an inquisition
as their examinations were said to be.
There was one tall, brown-bearded man at
the head of the table, who looked about
smilingly at the whole dining-room; he doubtless
imposed the most difficult questions of all
He made Sarah tremble.</p>

<p>If only the day were over and she knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
finally and certainly that she had not passed!
They would be glad to see her at home,
whether she succeeded or failed; and she
could hide her stupid head at the farm, and
the twins could have her chance. She tried not
to think of how wretched she would be if
she could never come back. She would never
see Ethel and Gertrude again, she would
never be able to think of the school with
pleasure. She remembered often that Laura
had said that coming back to school was
like coming back home. And Laura did not
have as many ties as Sarah had and would
have. Both William and Laura had graduated
there, and eventually the twins and
Albert would come too. Was she to disgrace
them all?</p>

<p>Suddenly her sad meditations were interrupted
by Miss Ellingwood.</p>

<p>"You must eat, Sarah. Finish your coffee
at least. See, they don't look so awesome, do
they?"</p>

<p>The brown-bearded Chairman heard, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
turned to Miss Ellingwood and laughed, and
then went on to speak in a round, friendly
voice. He had a strangely familiar accent.
He spoke a little as Sarah's father had spoken,
and as Henry Ebert and Uncle Daniel and
the other Pennsylvania Germans spoke.
Sarah thought that he might have come from
Spring Grove itself, and was not far wrong,
for he had learned his Pennsylvania-German
accent in another little town when he was
a boy, and would never lose it. He had evidently,
also, the Pennsylvania-German fondness
for a joke.</p>

<p>"Is she afraid we'll eat her up, Miss Ellingwood?"
he asked; at which a good deal
of Sarah's fright evaporated.</p>

<p>The chapel exercises were more solemn
than usual. It was a little like a service before
going into battle. At the door, Sarah
found Dr. Brownlee waiting to talk to her.
He felt her pulse, and laughed at her frightened
"Did you ever have to take such examinations?"
and told her that if she didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
pass, he'd give her still more bitter medicine.
Sarah almost skipped as she ran along the
board-walk to the recitation building.</p>

<p>The seats, which were assigned in the
largest class-rooms, were not given according
to classes. Sarah was in the back of the
great Drawing-room, a Junior boy beside her,
a Senior in front of her. Clutched in her hot
hand was her fountain-pen, a blotter, three
newly sharpened pencils, and two erasers. If
Sarah failed, it was not to be for lack of tools.
Even Edward Ellis, who sat next her, was
subdued, and gave her only a faint smile as
she arranged them on her desk.</p>

<p>In the front of the great room, Dr. Ellis
talked to the Board of Examiners. This was
the main examination room; from here all
the papers were given out, and thither they
were brought when collected. Sarah watched
the men absently, half of her mind trying to
bound China, when suddenly they all turned
and looked in her direction, and the man
with the brown beard smiled. Sarah was terror-stricken.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Was the principal telling them
that she would not pass? Perhaps he would
come to her and say that it was hardly worth
while for her to try. Sarah did not blame
her teachers for her breaking down; in her
opinion it was her own natural "dumbness."</p>

<p>But the examiner who distributed the
papers had already left one on her desk,
and she seized it, and gazed at the printed
questions. At first they looked entirely unfamiliar.
The two battles of Saratoga? Was
it part of Geography or Physiology? It was
certainly neither Spelling nor Arithmetic. She
frowned and the questions seemed to vanish,
and a blank page to stare her in the face.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, she remembered. The
battles of Saratoga took place on September
19 and October 7, 1777. But it was a History
question, and in History one was not
examined until the end of one's Junior year.
History was one of Ethel's and Gertrude's
subjects. But Sarah was not there to reason,
but to obey. She remembered her extra lessons,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
took courage, and read another question:
"Mention four causes of the Civil
War." That was easy! And there were only
five questions in all.</p>

<p>Presently, when she had answered three,
she ventured to lift her head. Another paper
had been laid on her desk. A new examiner
had just passed, his head turned toward
the other side of the room, as he answered a
question from one of the Seniors. This was
a double paper: there were four questions in
each of two branches, Arithmetic and Physiology.
To Sarah's great joy, these seemed
even less difficult. She finished the first paper
and attacked the second. Before she had
quite finished, the first examiner came to
collect, and with a long sigh she passed in
all the papers. She saw Mabel Thorn and
Ellen Ritter get up and go out, and with
them other sub-Juniors, but she did not stir.
She would wait until she was told to go. If
perseverance would help her through, that
should not be lacking.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>The distributor of papers looked at her a
little sharply as he went by.</p>

<p>"Physical Geography?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Sarah indistinctly.
She was beginning to be confused. She
could not remember whether she was to be
examined in Physical Geography or not, but
at least she would try. There were questions
in Latin on the same paper, and a half page
of translation. The translation was easy. She
remembered having read the little story with
Mr. Sattarlee. But she could not understand
why they should give her a Latin paper.
When one was given extra studies by mistake,
did one have to take examinations in
them?</p>

<p>She was afraid to ask questions. Mabel
Thorn had asked whether she must answer
all the questions in order to pass, and the
examiner had not answered her very pleasantly.
Evidently they did not like to be
questioned. Sarah was too excited to distinguish
between necessary and unnecessary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
questions. Bewildered, she set to work once
more.</p>

<p>The day was as hot as a June day can be.
Not a breath of air stirred the shades at the
windows, which did not seem to keep out a
bit of the hot sunshine. The examiners had
large palm-leaf fans, which they waved tantalizingly
back and forth. Occasionally a
student stopped writing long enough to fan
himself with his examination-paper or to mop
his brow. Not so Sarah. Her hand seemed
to stick to the paper, the perspiration ran
down her cheeks, but she did not stop.</p>

<p>Once "Bobs" Ellis furnished a slight diversion.
He wandered in in search of Edward,
and having found him walked lazily to the
front of the room, and sat down, panting, to
stare at the examiners. For a few minutes
he contemplated them gravely, then he
opened his mouth in a tremendous yawn and
stalked out. Every one but Sarah laughed
and felt better.</p>

<p>At noon Miss Ellingwood tried to coax
Sarah to eat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Were they hard, Sarah?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I guess so."</p>

<p>"You must lie down for a while after dinner,"
said Miss Ellingwood solicitously.
"And you mustn't say a word or think
about examinations."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," answered Sarah obediently.
She had meant to ask Miss Ellingwood
to help her to fathom the mystery of the
morning's examinations, but if Miss Ellingwood
did not wish to talk about examinations,
she would not insist. But she did not
lie down. She hunted up her spelling-book
and glanced once more at "phthisis" and
"relieve" and "receive," and all the words
which bothered her.</p>

<p>It was the middle of the afternoon before
she realized that she had written the answers
to seven sets of questions.</p>

<p>Several of the grammar questions had
baffled her completely, and when an examiner
had laid on her desk a sheet of drawing-paper,
and had intimated that she was to draw the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
fern which was placed near her on a table,
she had lifted her hand to protest. But no
one seemed to see her hand, and she lowered
it again and set desperately to work.</p>

<p>Edward Ellis, next to her, was also drawing
the fern, and he looked at her wonderingly.
Then he remembered that she had
been taking some Junior courses. It was that
which had made her ill. Perhaps they were
going to let her try the Junior examinations.
And at any rate the Board knew what it was
about. Edward stood in great awe of that
august body, and did not dare to offer any
objections to its proceedings.</p>

<p>Sarah was told also to draw the steps leading
to the platform, and she proceeded to
obey. She had had only elementary drawing.
She saw with alarm that the boys near her
were working with careful measurements
and ruling. She knew nothing about ruling,
or about holding up one's pencil and squinting
past it, or the rules of perspective by
which they worked so carefully. She only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
drew the steps as she had drawn things for
the twins, as they looked to her.</p>

<p>"Political Geography and Arithmetic and
Physiology and Spelling I was to be examined
in," she said to herself. "I have been
examined in Arithmetic and Physiology and
History and Latin and Physical Geography
and Grammar and Drawing, but not yet in
Spelling or Political Geography. Most of
these things do not come till next year.
<em>Ach</em>, I do not know what it means!"</p>

<p>The examiner had collected the papers
once more, and laid a new one on her desk.
Sarah glanced at it, then finally she raised
her voice in protest.</p>

<p>"I don't take Civil Government," she
said. "I never took it. I don't know anything
about it. If I knew anything about it,
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What class are you?" asked the examiner
shortly.</p>

<p>"The sub-Junior."</p>

<p>"Then you don't belong here." He spoke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
impatiently. He remembered that the papers
which she had handed in in the morning
were the most voluminous in the class.
Lengthy papers do not please gentlemen
who have hundreds to examine. "You belong
over in the other room, where the sub-Juniors
are being examined in Spelling.
You'll have to hurry. People that are late
are sometimes refused admission."</p>

<p>Sarah gathered pencils and erasers and
fountain-pen, and flew across the hall. The
examiner there received her even less cheerfully.</p>

<p>"You are very late," he said sharply.
"Spell 'picnicking.'"</p>

<p>He was somewhat mollified by her prompt
answer. Ten sub-Juniors had misspelled the
word.</p>

<p>Sarah breathed a long sigh and found a
seat. Her mind was suddenly clear; she felt
that she could not fail even if he gave her
all the hard words in the book. Here her
foot was on its native heath. William would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
be able to forgive her for knowing nothing
about Latin, but no Wenner would ever be
able to forgive her for being a poor speller.</p>

<p>Long after the examiner had marked them,
he continued to amuse himself by giving
them all the "catchy," treacherous words he
could think of. He coupled words on purpose
to snare them, "four" and "forty,"
"precede" and "proceed," "defendant"
and "precedent." He gave them all the
short, trying words, like "fiery," which half
the class spelled "f-i-r-e-y," and all the
long words, which one does not expect to
meet with outside the spelling-book, like
"eleemosynary" and "monocotyledon" and
"asseveration." When he finished, both he
and the students were out of breath. Of all
the class only Sarah had not missed a word.</p>

<p>"Are you the young lady who missed
time by being sick?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Umph!" said the examiner non-committally.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Ethel and Gertrude waited for Sarah outside
the door, and walked across the campus
with her. As in a dream she heard them discussing
their questions.</p>

<p>"The two battles of Saratoga were on
September 19 and October 7, 1777," said
Gertrude. "Gates was in command of the
Americans and Burgoyne of the British."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Ethel. "And the Treaty
of Ghent was the one which ended the War
of 1812, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Were those <em>your</em> questions?" asked
Sarah wearily.</p>

<p>"Yes, what were yours like?"</p>

<p>"<em>Ach</em>, I don't know. 'I want,'"&mdash;she
laughingly quoted a jingle which Miss Ellingwood
often repeated,&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"'I want to have my supper,<br />
<span class="fp">And I want to go to bed,'</span></p>

<p class="fp">and then I want to sleep and sleep and sleep,
and then I will not know for a long time
that I am put out of the Normal School."</p>

<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X <span class="subtit">THE CHAIRMAN MAKES A SPEECH</span></h2>

<p class="fp"><span class="smcap">The</span> wild uproar of the gymnasium entertainment
did not compare in intensity with
the suppressed excitement of the day following
examinations. There were no school-exercises
except a chapel-service in the morning,
which the students wished might be
longer, since it was all they had to occupy
them during the long and tedious day. The
girls wandered about from room to room,
the Seniors, who were to have a vacation of
a week before Commencement, packing their
trunks half-heartedly, the others doing nothing.
It did not seem worth while to begin
anything until one knew whether one was to
return.</p>

<p>The Board was closeted down in the principal's
office, where they worked from breakfast
till dark. Sometimes a student, passing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
through the hall when the door was opened,
saw them laboring at long tables, each with
a great pile of papers before him and a
pitcher of water hard by. If the student had
hoped for hot weather so that the Board
might be uncomfortable, he prayed now much
more fervently that their tempers might not
be influenced by the heat.</p>

<p>"They say the marks go down five points
whenever the thermometer goes up one,"
laughed Edward Ellis.</p>

<p>Sarah slept until long after breakfast-time.
When she woke Miss Ellingwood was
writing at her desk.</p>

<p>"Am I put out?" asked Sarah faintly.</p>

<p>"Not yet," answered Miss Ellingwood.
"Here is some breakfast for you."</p>

<p>Once in the history of the school, the
Board had finished its work before supper,
and the students who were wandering about
the fields back of the campus out of hearing
of the bell had to get their reports from Dr.
Ellis himself,&mdash;a sad duty for those who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
had failed. Since then no one ever wandered
away in the afternoon, for fear that the ominous
bell might ring and he not be there to
hear. Usually it did not ring till eight o'clock,
and sometimes it was ten. By that time hopes
had often sunk very low, and there were
strange rumors flying about.</p>

<p>"They say that ten Seniors have failed,
and half the Junior class," some one would
announce. "They're debating about them
now. Dr. Ellis thinks that some of them can
be changed."</p>

<p>The Secretary always shook his head
gloomily when applied to.</p>

<p>"I never knew such a year," was his invariable
response; and it never occurred to
any one to suppose that he meant a good
year.</p>

<p>As usual there was ice-cream for supper.
Gertrude Manley pretended to wave it aside.</p>

<p>"At dinner I might have been able to eat
a few mouthfuls," she groaned. "But now!
No, thank you!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>It was with a great sigh of relief that
Sarah watched her take a second helping.
Perhaps they were not as despairing as they
seemed. It would be bad enough if she
should not pass, but it would be much worse
if Ethel and Gertrude should fail.</p>

<p>Sarah spent the hours after supper wandering
up and down the hall which led to
the chapel. She did not expect to pass; the
calmer thought of to-day had convinced
her that she had been the victim of some
strange mistake in the giving out of the
papers. It was altogether her own fault.
She should have told them that she was not
a Junior.</p>

<p>In spite of her certainty, however, she was
wildly excited. No one could have been in
the school for a minute and have remained
calm. Miss Ellingwood was excited, and Dr.
Ellis and Eugene, who, when he passed an
anxious boy in the hall, drew his finger
across his throat to signify the operation in
which the State Board was engaged.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently Ethel and Gertrude came down
the hall.</p>

<p>"We were looking for you, Sarah."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it will ever ring," cried
Sarah.</p>

<p>"Hark!" said Ethel.</p>

<p>They heard the first faint ring of the
gong on the boys' side of the building, then
the bell rang sharply above their heads.</p>

<p>"Our fate is sealed!" cried Gertrude.
"We are doomed. Come on to the slaughter!"</p>

<p>She seized Ethel by one hand and Sarah
by the other, and they were the first to reach
the chapel-stairs. Behind them doors were
opening, and there was the sound of hurrying
steps and excited voices.</p>

<p>"Let us sit here on the last row," suggested
Sarah.</p>

<p>"So that we can be more easily borne
hence," laughed Gertrude.</p>

<p>The State Board was already seated on
the platform. They were all talking and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
laughing as heartily as they had the day
before. The Chairman carried a paper in his
hand. He made some joke about it, and his
colleagues all laughed; then he laid it down
on a long box on the table by his side.</p>

<p>"The names are on that paper," whispered
Ethel.</p>

<p>"Yours is," answered Sarah, "but mine
isn't. I know that much."</p>

<p>Mercifully Sarah was not kept long in
suspense. The students had never gathered
so quickly. The doors were closed, and then
Dr. Ellis announced that the Chairman would
read the names of those who had passed.</p>

<p>The brown-bearded Chairman rose slowly,
still laughing with the man next to him.
Then he looked out solemnly over the audience
and the audience looked back solemnly
at him. He lifted the paper from the table,
looked at it solemnly too, and then laid it
back.</p>

<p>"Nobody passed, perhaps," whispered
Sarah.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chairman had begun to speak.</p>

<p>"Ladies and Gentlemen," he said. "I am
not going to hurt you." At which there was
a great laugh, and then a settling back into
easier positions. "You all look so frightened
and so sure that you have failed, that you
make us feel that our judgment is at fault
and that we have made a mistake to let any
of you through. There, that's better! Once,
a good many years ago, when I was a little
boy&mdash;" He stopped and looked at them
comically over his glasses&mdash;"Which would
you rather have first, the story about the
time when I was a little boy, or the names?
All in favor of the names say '<em>Ay</em>.'"</p>

<p>The response left no room for doubt upon
that question.</p>

<p>"Well, then. We'll take the sub-Juniors
first. Those who have passed are&mdash;" The falling
of the proverbial pin would have made a
loud noise in the silence which ensued. Sarah
felt a frightened thrill run up and down her
back. Suppose she <em>should</em> pass! How glorious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
it would be! Then William and Laura
would feel that their faith in her had been
warranted, that their sacrifice was not in vain.
It would encourage the twins to study, it
would astonish the neighbors. Sarah leaned
forward, one hand tight in Ethel's, one in
Gertrude's. Suppose she should pass!</p>

<p>It seemed to her hours before she leaned
limply back. Her name was not on the list.
She had been mad to expect it. Mabel
Thorn's was there and Ellen Ritter's; she
had thought they were stupid and lazy, yet
they had passed. The girl who had packed
her ink-bottle in her trunk had passed. Even
she could answer State Board questions. Any
of these would have had sense enough to
object if they had been given Junior papers
instead of some of their own.</p>

<p>She felt her companions' hands tighten
sympathetically on her own, and she struggled
bravely to keep back the tears. She
would not cry. Not even if they expelled her
would she cry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>The cheerful voice went on reading. Ethel
and Gertrude had passed; they let go of
Sarah's hands for an instant to clasp each
other's, and smiled at each other above her
head, while she looked at them sadly. They
were Middlers now, and in another year they
would be Seniors with all the Senior privileges.
They would study Psychology and
Methods of Teaching, and they would begin
to teach in the Model School and lead the
gymnasium classes, and soon they would be
gone. Even if Sarah were allowed to come
back to redeem herself, they would be too far
ahead to think of her. She would have to
make friends anew, and&mdash;</p>

<p>The list of Juniors was finished and the
speaker folded his paper.</p>

<p>"The Middlers have all passed," he said,
smiling, and a wild cheer responded. The
excitement was no longer to be kept under
control.</p>

<p>"As for the Seniors&mdash;" The Chairman
paused. The cheer died down into silence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
It was time once more to drop the proverbial
pin.</p>

<p>"They have all passed too."</p>

<p>Then Bedlam suddenly broke loose. Boys
and girls were on their feet, there was cheer
after cheer, and Dr. Ellis sat smiling and
making no effort to subdue them. Perhaps
it would have been a relief to him to join.
His pupils had never done so well.</p>

<p>After a long time the Chairman held up
his hand.</p>

<p>"I have still more to say," he declared.
"And after I am through with the announcements
you will still have to listen to my story
about the time when I was a little boy. But
first I have a story to tell about a little girl.</p>

<p>"When we are boys and girls, we are
taught to think that our teachers are infallible,
that they can never make mistakes, and
it is good for us to think so. It is equally
good for us to find out later that teachers
and grown-up people have made mistakes.
It makes us feel easier about our own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is a young lady in this school who
has found this out. She came here to learn
something about books, after a hard experience
had taught her many more valuable
lessons, and this is the way the teachers
treated her. Instead of giving her as little
to do as possible, and watching to see that
she played, and taking her books away from
her by force if necessary, they began to give
her extra work to do. It wasn't altogether
their fault, because they were not accustomed
to having to restrain pupils. Overstudy is a
little like smallpox. Many doctors wouldn't
recognize smallpox because they have never
seen a case. It was the same way with these
teachers who let this girl work too hard.</p>

<p>"That, one would think, was enough hardship
for one year. But worse things were to
happen to her.</p>

<p>"Yesterday&mdash;and this story is a terrible
confession for a State Board official to make&mdash;yesterday
the State Board gave her the
wrong papers. The principal told us about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
her,&mdash;I suppose he meant us to mark her
as easily as we could. But the examiner who
distributed the sub-Junior papers thought
that the principal had said she was a sub-Junior,
and the examiner who distributed
the Junior papers thought she was a Junior,
and so both gave her papers, and she&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gertrude Manley felt suddenly a head
against her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Why, Sarah!" she whispered, and saw
only a bit of scarlet cheek.</p>

<p>"And she," the Chairman went on, "being
accustomed to having extra work, said
nothing and sawed wood, with this result."
He unfolded again the paper in his hand.</p>

<p>"She passed the Arithmetic, Physiology,
and Spelling which she was expected to pass,
with good marks. She did not take the sub-Junior
Political Geography, but she passed
the Junior Physical Geography and the
Junior Latin and the Junior History with
good marks. In these branches I believe she
did the extra work during the winter. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Junior Grammar, which includes the sub-Junior
Grammar, she just made passing mark.
We tried to persuade ourselves that she
hadn't really passed, but she was too much
for us. Even when a fern and some steps
were thrust before her to be drawn, she did
not falter but drew them. The Civil Government
paper she did not attempt, which surprised
us greatly. It was very inconsiderate
of the teacher of Civil Government not to
give her extra lessons too. I think Dr. Ellis
should speak to him about it. And now, what
shall we do with this girl?"</p>

<p>Not one of the gasping students offered a
suggestion.</p>

<p>"Well, there are several possibilities,"
went on the Chairman. "We can say that
inasmuch as she hasn't passed her sub-Junior
Geography, she hasn't passed at all and will
have to take the year over. But that doesn't
seem fair. Or we can say that she is a Junior
in spite of the Geography. The only objection
to that is that she will grow very lazy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
next year with nothing new to study but Civil
Government. Not all of us approve of that.
Then there is one other plan. We can make
her a Middler, with the provision that she
makes up the Civil Government some time
within the next two years. It is unprecedented,
but it can be done. What does the
school think of this plan?"</p>

<p>The pupils looked about in complete mystification.
Was it all true, or was it only a
story? Then a few of them began to guess
whom the Chairman meant. One of them
was Edward Ellis.</p>

<p>"I think she should be made a Middler,"
he said.</p>

<div class="image">
<div class="figcenter"><a name="image186"><img src="images/image186.jpg" alt="Illustration: HE KEPT HER BESIDE HIM" width="450" height="650" /></a></div>
<div class="caption">HE KEPT HER BESIDE HIM</div>
</div>

<p class="space-above">"Very well, so be it." The Chairman
opened the box at his side. "I wish that
State Boards did not change, so that we
might all come back here next year and
make it easy for this young lady; but since
we can't, we wish to apologize to her, and to
give her a little present to remember us by."
He lifted a great handful of roses from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
box. "And now, good-by, and good luck."
And he stood still with the bouquet in his
hands, forgetting apparently the promised
story of his boyhood.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, with a smile, his voice more
Pennsylvania-German than ever, "where is
this Sarah Wenner, about whom I have been
talking?"</p>

<p>Ethel Davis's voice shook.</p>

<p>"Go and get your flowers, youngster."</p>

<p>"I can't."</p>

<p>"You must. Run along."</p>

<p>She rose to let Sarah pass, and then some
one near by stood up to see, and in a moment
the school was on its feet and some one was
singing. It was the old tune which for many
years had closed the session of the State
Board, the long-metre doxology. They finished
the first line as the Chairman put the
flowers into Sarah's arms. Then, seeing what
a little girl she was, he laid his hand on her
shoulder and kept her beside him, while he
startled her with his great bass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>And Sarah gave up trying to puzzle out
how what the Chairman said could be true.
She saw Ethel smiling at her and Gertrude
waving her hand, and Professor Minturn and
Miss Ellingwood and Mr. Sattarlee laughing
together at the back of the room, and she
grew a little less frightened and clasped her
flowers a little more tightly in her arms. The
troubles of the past year seemed to dwindle,
the joys to grow, until it was all joy and happiness,
and she lifted up her voice and sang out
with all her heart.</p>
